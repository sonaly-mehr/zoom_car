<p>Harsh Pamnani is a brand storyteller. His bestselling book series Booming Brands, covering inspiring journeys of new-age ‘Made in India’ brands, is published by CNBC. Besides, he has written 70 plus articles in publications such as Forbes. In Booming Brands Volume -2, he covered the journey of Zoomcar. We caught up in a quick chat with him to discuss his book series and why he chose Zoomcar’s story. Excerpts from the conversation: </p>



<p><strong>WHAT MADE YOU WRITE BOOMING BRANDS?</strong></p>



<p>Since childhood, I have been curious to understand how a few entrepreneurs create admirable brands while many struggle. To satisfy my curiosity, I have read numerous biographies and case studies.</p>



<p>One of the problems with these resources was that they were filled with American examples. Every market is different. The brand-building strategies, which worked in developed markets like America, may not work in developing markets like India. Some literature is available around Indian corporates, but many large corporates were born in the pre-liberalization and pre-digital era, and have grown over the decades. Their approaches might not be directly applicable to many businesses of the new era. Moreover, I had interacted with many professionals, MBA students, and professors, who expressed that they want to know in detail about the journeys of new-age Indian brands like Zoomcar. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Noticing this void, I felt I could create a resource that could be leveraged by people interested in understanding how new age ‘Made in India’ brands are getting created.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO INCLUDE ZOOMCAR AS A CASE STUDY IN YOUR BOOK?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Zoomcar is a pioneer. It has created the category of self-drive car rental service in India. By becoming an intermediary between car owners and consumers who don&#8217;t know each other, Zoomcar is not only facilitating an economic exchange, cost savings, and convenience, but also enabling environmental benefits on a large scale.</p>



<p>Personally speaking, Mr. Greg Moran’s journey has inspired me a lot. I admire how he identified an enormous opportunity in India, dropped out of a top business school in America, came to a new country, fought multiple challenges, and built a popular brand.&nbsp; Besides, the kind of innovations Zoomcar has introduced and the kind of employee development programs it has started are commendable.</p>



<p>Additionally, the stories of Indians like Vinod Khosla and Sabeer Bhatia, who moved from India to Silicon Valley and founded companies like Sun Microsystems and Hotmail, are very popular. But the inspiring stories of Americans who moved to India and made their mark here are mostly unheard of. This is one such story, and I wanted to take it to the masses.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT ZOOMCAR’S STORYTELLING? WHY SHOULD CONSUMERS, STUDENTS &amp; THE START-UP ECOSYSTEM KNOW MORE ABOUT IT?</strong></p>



<p>As you can imagine, in today&#8217;s crowded market, when customers&#8217; attention span is short, creating brand awareness is a difficult task. Interestingly, Zoomcar stands out in a crowded market. I think, Zoomcar&#8217;s interesting experiments, innovations, and campaigns have become sources of numerous stories that have played an instrumental role in popularizing the brand.</p>



<p>For instance, when Zoomcar started, car vendors charged an absurd amount of deposit money while giving a car on rent. However, Zoomcar made it possible with only Rs. 5,000 refundable deposit. &nbsp;Around Friendship Day, Zoomcar replicated a car from the movie called &#8216;Dumb and Dumber.&#8217; This car named ‘K9 Cruiser’ looked like a dog and was taken around many cities. Also, during Ganesh Chaturthi, Zoomcar created a car that looked like a mouse, and they called it ‘Mushak’. Amusingly, the Zoomcar team listed a horse named ‘Dhanno’ and an auto on the platform. Interestingly, these experiments gave birth to many stories and contributed to a lot of word of mouth.</p>



<p>Also, Zoomcar’s YouTube music video that conveys the story of a group of friends who use Zoomcar for their next trip became viral and connected people with the brand. Then, Zoomcar’s partnership with digital channel Filter Copy for a web series – &#8216;What The Folks&#8217; made the brand very popular among youngsters. Besides, your ZAP Subscribe TV advertisements have also been very catchy.</p>



<p><strong>HOW HAS THE RESPONSE TO THE BOOK BEEN TO DATE?</strong></p>



<p>Booming Brands has received a tremendous response. I would like to express my gratitude to leaders like Mr. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Nestle India; Mr. Sunil Kant Munjal, Chairman, Hero Enterprise; Prof. Rishikesha Krishnan, Director, IIM Bangalore; Mr. Harsh Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises; Ms. Samina Hamied, Executive Vice Chairperson, Cipla and others who gave me their precious testimonials.</p>



<p>I am very grateful to CNBC TV18 for publishing my book. I received great feedback from many marketing professors from prestigious business schools. For example, Booming Brands was released at XLRI, Jamshedpur, and professors of international business schools such as Prof. Kartik Hosanagar and Prof. David Bell from Wharton, and Prof. Anand Narasimhan from IMD have appreciated Booming Brands. Recently, the Marketing and Advertising Club at Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSoM), IIT Kharagpur, also appreciated Booming Brands!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT HAVE BEEN YOUR LEARNINGS AS AN AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS NOW, ESPECIALLY ON THE PUBLICITY &amp; MARKETING SIDE?</strong></p>



<p>Content is the king! People love stories. Readers found stories in Booming Brands helpful, and that led to a lot of word of mouth. Further, tweets by leaders like Mr. Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, Government of India, and Mr. Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of Marico, helped a lot. Also, coverage by reputed media platforms was beneficial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Come to think of it, while adjusting to the new normal, don’t you think trips with your friends have become a thing of the past? When did you go on a trip or a vacation recently?</p>



<p>All our travel plans had to be canceled or brought to a halt due to the risk of virus contraction during the pandemic. Now, a trip to the grocery store feels like a short trip away from home.

<p>Work. Home. Sleep. Repeat. The work from home regimen in this new normal has started to take a toll on us, and we are all trying to break free from the monotony and stress of it. The most challenging aspect is that due to the monotonous routine, our productivity gets hampered as well.</p>



<p>If you feel the same pressure and are in dire need of some respite, then you need to bring a fresh change in your life. The best transition from this mundane lifestyle is planning a trip to a nearby place. Although, if you are worried about the travel arrangement, then fret not. You can explore options like <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term car subscription services</a></strong> that will enable you to travel privately.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17594" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Personal mobility is a concept that has gained importance in these unexpected times. Car rental services are the main force behind this concept. You can travel safely and ensure limited contact with people. The chances of virus transmission will significantly reduce with this one minor change.</p>



<p>Just hop in a rented car with your family and visit a nearby place to rejuvenate. We at Zoomcar offer numerous car options like SUVs, sedans, and Innovas for your comfort. Another factor adding to your convenience is the availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">monthly car-rental services</a></strong> as well as <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long- term car rental</a></strong> services.</p>



<p>Why wait when you can book any of these and explore famous places like the following:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Igatpuri:</strong> <strong>Abode For Adventure Enthusiasts</strong></li></ol>



<p>With only a distance of 130 kms from Mumbai, Igatpuri, a charming hill station, is the ideal vacation spot. Drive down the Mumbai-Agra highway and reach this destination for solace. A popular choice, especially during Mumbai monsoons, Igatpuri is home to the majestic waterfalls and tall mountains.</p>



<p>Explore the old forts and indulge in outdoor activities like rock climbing and trekking. Channel your inner artistic photographer at the Bhatsa river valley, Camel valley, and the Randha falls. Last but not least, enjoy a mesmerizing view from the top of the Trngalwadi fort.</p>



<p>If, however, after visiting this place, you want to spend some more time amidst nature, you can extend your stay easily. Work from the weekend destination with a fresh mind. Traveling back is not an issue with having a vehicle with you. Opt for the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term self-drive car rental service</a></strong> from us and extend your vacation without giving it another thought.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17595" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Kashid: Land of Sandy Beaches</strong></li></ol>



<p>Head to Kashid, a beach town, just 125 kms from Mumbai city, and explore the white sandy beaches and blue seas. Soothing and a calm place surrounded by lush green landscapes, this beach is also known for its striking mountains. With a serene environment and a shore that stretches to a vast extent, is the ideal destination for a mini-holiday.</p>



<p>The spellbound appearance with its pristine water and clean beaches makes you want to stay for a longer time. You can also explore the nearby areas like Chaul, which is a vantage point for Buddhist caves. Another place of public interest includes the Korlai fort. Experience the royal heritage in this phenomenal monument.</p>



<p>If you need to use the local transport in these vacation spots, you can avoid that with a car by your side. Even when you are eating out, ensure that you pick up food from the eateries following the social distancing norms instead of dining in. Especially when you are traveling, it will be wise to carry some snacks and beverages for the way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Long-Term Car Subscription Service: Saviour for the Times Ahead</strong></p>



<p>Deciding to opt for a <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term car rental</a> </strong>service has never been more advantageous. Considering the present situation, there is no vaccine for the virus as of yet. Thus, these short trips will be the only way for an escape from the everyday routine. Such frequent trips will require a safe mode of transportation. Nothing better than having a vehicle at your side for all times. If you are unsure about the service, we at Zoomcar offer <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">monthly car rental services</a></strong>. Subscribe to it and determine how <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term car rental</a> </strong>service is a viable option for you. Other than that, we provide many benefits like an all India permit so that you can travel without any bounds while planning your vacation. We also offer damage insured and thoroughly sanitized vehicles. We ensure that the car gets dropped at your doorstep in under thirty minutes after subscribing for your convenience. Here’s to your much-needed break from the WFH routine!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 brought along with it a tough challenge for the world. Especially the past few months spent under lockdown have been tiring mentally. We all can agree to this!</p>



<p>However, these last few months have taught one thing – Better Be Safe Than Sorry! After the lockdown-unlock, public transport has started to run; schools are opening up, and so are offices. Thus, it would help if you viewed everything, especially your commutation options, from a safety aspect. Re-starting public transportation services might be a practical decision to ensure a normality step, but it does not guarantee safety. On the other hand, personal mobility enables security and safety while traveling.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17273" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With personal mobility, you can upkeep the norm of social distancing and travel without worrying. The availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> will enable you to travel privately if you do not own a car. If you are hesitant about these services, you can <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">subscribe a car</a></strong> for a day and see for yourself. Our services, at Zoomcar, offer vehicles for varying durations- daily, monthly, weekly, and annual.</p>



<p>The best aspect is that subscribing to a car will have similar advantages to having a personal vehicle. It enables you to travel in all kinds of situations, such as:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Day-to-Day Travel</strong></li></ol>



<p>With resuming offices, you might have to start traveling daily. If you availed the public transport services like buses and metros for commutation before the coronavirus outbreak, it would not be wise to do so now. Cases are still on the rise every day, so it is important that you carefully consider daily commutation options. As an easy alternative, you opt for <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> and travel securely instead.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day to day life is made easier with having a personal vehicle. Don’t you agree?</span></strong></p>



<p>Instead of the hassles of using public transport, you can commute independently and freely whenever you want. The need for personal mobility has increased from a safety aspect due to the coronavirus outbreak. Personal mobility ensures that you are able to limit interaction with people, allowing you to follow the protocols of social distancing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16977" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If, however, you do not own a vehicle, you can always opt for car rental services. A significant advantage is that we, at Zoomcar, offer <strong>short term car rental</strong> services as well as long-term rental cars in Pune.</p>



<p>Having a <strong>short term car rental</strong> service is the best solution to enjoy the same benefits that come with a personal car, such as the following:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Safety</strong></li></ol>



<p>It has already been established that the coronavirus has a high tendency to spread faster in crowded places, so it will be wise to avoid such areas. Today, with the slow and steady unlocking of the country, offices have started to resume work, schools have started with their session, and travelers are out to travel again.</p>



<p>Considering that we don’t have a vaccine for the virus yet, car rental services are a blessing for those who need or want to travel safely and securely. Suppose you are unsure about opting for long-term car rental. In that case, you can enjoy our <strong>short term car subscription services</strong> like the <strong>daily car rental service</strong> or the <strong>weekly car rental service</strong>. This way, you can easily determine if a long-term car subscription is the right choice for you. Another safety aspect that a <strong>daily car rental service</strong> provides is that it offers protection against the possibility of virus transmission. Like, if you hail a cab, you will be in contact with the cab driver due to currency exchange, and you will be breathing the same air as them. To avoid such a situation, you should opt for personal mobility and <strong>rent a car for a short term. </strong>You will be driving the vehicle yourself and thus eliminating the risk of coming in contact with strangers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16978" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Self-Reliance</strong></li></ol>



<p>The best aspect of having a vehicle at all times is that you will not have to rely on anyone else. Suppose you have old grandparents or an expecting wife, and an emergency arises. In that case, you won’t have to wait for your friends or relatives. Commuting via public transport is out of the question in such critical times; it will be best to have a car at your doorstep.</p>



<p>With <strong>short term car rental</strong> services, you can assure yourself with safety as well as convenience, and if you are comfortable with the service, you can extend it. At Zoomcar, we offer car rentals on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis for you to select from.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Affordable Travelling</strong></li></ul>



<p>Buying a vehicle at this juncture should be avoided. If you had to dip in your savings due to the pandemic, it might turn out to be a considerable investment. Therefore, the ideal option is to avail of a <strong>short term car rental</strong> service, the next best alternative. While providing all the facilities that a personal vehicle offers, it is an inexpensive solution to your travel worries.</p>



<p>If you are bored working from home and feel as if life has become dull, you can plan a short weekend getaway. As already mentioned above, the country is moving towards a completed unlock. Hence, the weekend resorts and tourists place are open for visiting. Having a rented vehicle will save the transportation costs of reaching the destination and also secure your trip. If you become satisfied with the <strong>short term rental </strong>service, you can avail of our long-term car subscription and plan such getaways from time to time.</p>



<p><strong>Travel Safe And Happy</strong></p>



<p>We at Zoomcar provide many other benefits, including the ones mentioned above. These include cars with damage insurance and an-all India permit. Now, plan your short trips without any worry. In a situation where the car breaks down in the middle of the road, we ensure that help reaches you with our 24x 7 roadside assistance benefit. We also make certain that all our cars are thoroughly sanitized after every use. Additionally, we make sure that the vehicle is dropped off at your doorstep within thirty minutes of subscribing for your convenience. &nbsp;We prioritize your well-being and ensure that you can travel everywhere with the utmost security.

<p>Traveling influences the lives of most individuals in positive ways. Whether it’s an ‘around-the-world’ adventure or a quick weekend getaway, travel is essential for peace of mind. However, this year, many travel plans had to be put on hold due to the pandemic. Moreover, due to the hectic work-from-home lifestyle and lockdown, life has become a bit dull and drab for everyone. Making everyone long for some fresh air, away from home, and having fun experiences.<br><br>However, now that things have started to get a bit normalized, traveling has been resumed. Although, it is imperative to remember that risks and insecurities of virus transmission still lingers. There is a simple solution to counter this problem, especially for those who love to travel – the option of choosing a secure and safe mode of traveling with personal mobility options. Getting a <strong>self-drive car subscription</strong> enables you to travel within and outside the city as per your comfort, while ensuring that you stay safe and secure!<br><br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16647" width="673" height="449" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Personal mobility has gained momentum as it provides much-needed support in these uncertain times. It enables you to move around with some freedom and lets you breathe a sigh of relief. If, however, you do not have a personal vehicle, do not feel trapped. There are car rental services like Zoomcar that allow you to enjoy personal mobility with a <strong>self-drive car subscription</strong>.</p>



<p>If you live in Bangalore, you can use these <strong>safe car subscription service</strong>s and visit nearby places. This way, you can ensure safety as well as get a break from the monotonous schedule. Given below are three sites which are considered as the best escape for a short weekend trip:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Coorg: Scotland of India</strong></li></ul>

Weather around this time is pleasant and refreshing. You will get to witness the gorgeous rainfall cut through the luscious green hills.</p>



<p>While there are many things to do in this area, you can complete the Brahmagiri Peak trip, which will be a splendid chance. Apart from this, you can enjoy cycling, biking in the peaks of this hill station. Other places like Abbey waterfalls, Nagarhole National park, Namdroling Nyingmapa Monastery are tourist spots that you can visit for experiencing serenity.</p>



<p>Planning this short weekend trip is made easy with rental cars as they provide safe and secure travel. Instead of using public transport mode, you can take a <strong>self-drive car subscription</strong> from Zoomcar and follow social distancing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16648" width="682" height="455" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The extensive fauna and flora will be a nice change from your house’s four walls and uplift your mood. Visit the Doddamakali nature fishing camp and relax for the weekend.</p>



<p>Even if you are looking for a one-day getaway, you can travel by opting for a <strong>car subscription for a day</strong>. Otherwise, you can avail <strong>car subscription for a week</strong> and spend quality time with your loved ones. We provide thoroughly sanitized cars that enable you to ensure security. You can also carry an extra supply of hand sanitizers and masks and store them in the rented vehicle. In this manner, you will not run out of them and remain safe at all times.</p>
