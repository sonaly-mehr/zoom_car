<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road to Independence was certainly not an easy one for India. It took effort and sacrifices from countless martyrs and civilians whom we celebrate today. Let&#8217;s take a walk down some memorable roads that you could plan a drive to, and let the patriotism hit you right in the feels.</span></p>



<p><strong>Mumbai, Hutatma Chowk</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6785 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6785" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211; Flickr</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in the busy business quarters of Fort. Hutatma Chowk derives its name from an incident of the past where the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was fired upon by the police during a peaceful protest leading to 105 deaths. &nbsp;A statue of a &#8220;Martyr with a Flame&#8221; next to the Flora Fountain stands as a memorial to the martyrs. The Flora Fountain was built in 1860. It was built at a total cost of Rs. 47,000, a large sum in those days. It represents the Roman Goddess Flora, the Goddess of Abundance. The Fountain is an intricately sculpted piece of art and a historical monument.</span></p>

The annual Republic Day parade takes place on 26 January on Rajpath. Considered one of the most important roads in India, the avenue is lined on both sides by huge lawns, canals, and rows of trees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally Staunton Road, named after Francis Staunton a British captain, who led the troops in the Battle of Koregaon Bhima where the Marathas were defeated. Maneckji Mehta Road has been laid out by the British East India Company and subsequently by the British Army in a grid-like fashion, with almost military precision. Roads turn at right-angles and modifications are appropriate at places where artillery and soldiers were stationed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and friendship are a human&#8217;s anchor through the tumultuous storm called &#8216;life&#8217;. As you casually pass through your journey you see this person sailing through theirs and your head goes, &#8220;Hey mate, you could use some life-support, and this looks like an apt candidate!&#8221;. Unlike most missed romantic first-chances, you do not let this go. You see them sitting next to you in school, or across the table in the college canteen. You see them eating your favorite dish at the restaurant, or overhear them speaking of the football club you love. And before you know it you&#8217;re crying to them at 3AM about how you sacrificed your last toffee for a girl you liked when you were 5.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friendship is undeniably a major moving force in ones life. You were dodging the 8 PM traffic on SV Road all alone. Now you&#8217;re moving steady, at 60 kmph on a lovely highway with your mates singing “Yaad karegi duniya, tera mera afsana”. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bollywood has, over the years, portrayed friendships in the most adorable, envy-worthy manner. We put down our 5 all-time favorite on-the-move friendship movies (just in case you want to have a movie night with the gang).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving through the virgin streets of Spain, the boy trio redefined friendship in movies. The movie showcased the simplistic manner in which life unfolds. How over the span of a road trip fences mend, wounds heal, love happens and the worst fears are overcome. Watch it for the life lessons and intermittent doses of melodrama; and of course great music.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6762" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting vacation goals for entire generation, and seeding the Goa love was Dil Chahta Hai. A Bollywood gem based on the most inevitable phases of life. We&#8217;re sure someone in your troop is the real-life counterpart of the carefree Akash, lover boy Sameer or artsy Sid. The beauty of the film is in how it remains relatable over years, they don&#8217;t just call it the Bible of Friendship you see.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one could be a hit or miss! Based in the more silent and serene parts of Goa, Finding Fanny is an unusual film. Unusual misfit characters thrown together due to an unusual happening. As they proceed through the road-trip, you fall in love with the characters and their quirks, their journey and destinations. The beauty of Goa, a bunch of talented actors and a short sweet film.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6763" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430.jpg 1280w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26fae8788f8c857b49d1b6b894ed23ffcff10430-850x478.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve found your best friend in your partner, well you&#8217;ve hit the jackpot and how! Jab We Met celebrates the fun, adventurous, friendship side of a romantic relationship. Geet and Aditya share a one of a kind journey, both literally and metaphorically. Accompanied with some breathtaking locations and a fair share of humour, this musical comedy drama is hard to dislike.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6764" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2.jpg 1280w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maxresdefault-2-850x478.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painting a picturesque story of the father-daughter duo travelling to Kolkata; Piku is the movie if you&#8217;re celebrating Friendship with your family. The road trip brings Piku closer to her ageing father despite disparities. Seeing their relationship manifest will definitely leave you teary-eyed. Have the tissue box close. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you celebrate your friends this Friendship Day! Whether it is your childhood buddies or friends who have now drifted apart, remember what Bollywood taught us, &#8216;there&#8217;s nothing a road trip can&#8217;t fix&#8217;! If you were looking for a sign of reassurance, this is it! What are you waiting for? Make that WhatsApp group, book a Zoomcar and hit the road. Happy Friendship Day!</span></p>
