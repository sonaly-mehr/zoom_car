<p class="has-drop-cap">The Lord of Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles- Vigneshwara, the God of prosperity, wisdom, wealth and knowledge- Vinayaka, Lord Ganesha. Also known as Ganpati- the Lord of People, Ganesha holds a supreme position among the Hindu Gods and lots of adoration and love from the people. His charming, friendly and forgiving nature makes him a favourite of kids and adults alike.</p>



<p>The son of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha was created by his mother to guard her house while she bathed. She was looking for someone who would devoutly protect her, and when she failed to think of anyone, she created her son Ganesha from the turmeric (used for bathing) from her body. Parvati demanded of Lord Brahma that Ganpati be brought back to life and worshipped before all other Gods after Shiva beheaded him (that is how Ganesha got his elephant-head).</p>



<p>The birthday of the people’s God, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated all over India with a lot of pomp and devotion. Multitudes of devotees offer their respects in their own fashion. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi has many variations across states. Ganesh Temples are magnificently decorated, aartis are sung, offerings are made. If you’ve been to a Ganesh Pandal or Temple during Ganesh Chaturthi you have undoubtedly felt the aura and power of strong-willed devotion, unwavering faith and belief in God surround you.</p>



<p>If it’s been a while since you felt the feeling, head out this Ganesh Chaturthi with your friends and family. It’ll be a lovely spiritual outing and an experience for you as a family that you will make memories at and can tell stories of. We’ve listed down some Ganesh Temples in India you could visit this Ganesh Chaturthi.</p>

<p><strong>1. Arulmigu Ucchi Pillaiyar Temple, Rockfort, Trichy, Tamil Nadu</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6824 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6824" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02.jpg 900w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;http://www.tajtravelstrichy.com/</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Located in Rockfort, Trichy approximately 329 kms and a 6-hour drive from Chennai, Arulmigu Ucchi Pillaiyar Temple was made in the 7th Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>History believes the rock on which this temple stands in the place where Lord Ganesha disguised as a kid ran from King Vibhishana after installing the Ranganathaswamy deity in Srirangam. When Vibhishan ran to follow this kid, he climbed on a rock. Vibhishana hit him on the forehead, and that is when the child revealed himself as Ganesha. A dent can still be seen in the idol of Ganesha at this temple.</p>



<p>Made by the Pallavas and Nayaks the temple is now maintained by the Archeological Department of India. Placed atop a rock, with stairs leading to the shrine, the temple offers a beautiful view of Trichy, Srirangam and the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam.</p>



<p>On the same rock is also a Siva Temple. You could also stop to visit the Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam which is only 4 kms and a 20-minute drive away from Ucchi Pillaiyar. You could visit the temple’s website for more information.</p>



<p><strong>2. Sri Swayambhu Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Devastanam, Kanipakam, Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6825 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6825" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2.jpg 512w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;androidappsapk</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>Approximately 177 kms and a 5-hour drive from Bangalore the Vinayaka Temple in Chittoor was built in the 11th Century.  </strong></em></p>



<p>The idol at this Ganesha temple is Swayambhu (self-manifested). It was revealed to 3 blind, deaf and dumb farmers who were digging up the dried out well for water. When their equipment hit the idol, it oozed out blood and flooded the river. This blood healed them of their deformities. The original idol is still at the temple and the springs of the well eternal. The water from these springs is offered to devotees as holy water. The idol is also said to be growing in size. A Silver Armour offered to the idol by a devotee 50 years ago, no longer fits it.</p>



<p>The temple here was built by the Chola Dynasty King Kulothunga Chola I and the work was further expanded by the Vijayanagara Dynasty.</p>



<p><strong>3. Sri Maha Ganapathy Temple, HMT Kalamassery, Kochi, Kerala</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>A 21.4 km and approximately 45 minutes drive via the Kochi Panvel Highway, the Mahaganapathy Temple was built in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Built by a pious Late Mr N Ragunatha Menon and his children who lived in Kalamassery, the Mahaganapathy Temple also houses shrines to Subramaniam, the Navgrahas, Shiva, Parvathi, Rama, Dakshinamurthi and Chandikeshwara. The temple has a simple style of construction and has no outer walls. A Peepal tree stands in front of the Ganapathy Shrine. How close it is the busy Eloor-Kalamassery Road has also earned the diety the name of ‘Roadside Ganapathy’.</p>



<p><strong>4. Shree Dodda Ganapathi Temple, Bull Temple Rd, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6826" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695.jpg 1600w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>A 6 km and 25-minute drive from Bangalore, the Dodda Ganapathi Temple was built in the 16th Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>The Dodda Ganapathi Temple is right next to the Bull Temple/Nandi Temple. It houses a large idol of Ganesha. The temple is adorned in different ways of decoration throughout the week. One of the interesting ones being the Benne Alankara or butter coating on the idol. About 100 kgs of butter is used for the same. The devotees at this temple also believe that the idol grows in size every year.</p>



<p>The temple surroundings are quiet and beautiful, and the experience of visiting the temple is a powerful one. While there you can, of course, visit the Nandi Temple close by, another must visit is the Bugle Rock Park.</p>



<p><strong>5. Karpaka Vinayakar, Pillayarpatti, Tiruppathur Taluk, Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6828 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pillayarpatti_temple.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6828" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pillayarpatti_temple.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pillayarpatti_temple-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pillayarpatti_temple-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pillayarpatti_temple-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;wikimedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>A 243 km and 6-hour drive from Coimbatore and 14 kms and 40 minutes from Chennai, the Karpaka Vinayakar Temple was built in the 4th Century and is a cave temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The temple has a 6-feet rock cut Pillaiyar deity and is the only one of its kind in Tamil Nadu. It was built by the early Pandyas and is now about 2500 years old. The temple also houses rock cut sculptures of Lord Shiva, Karthiyayini (Goddess who arranges marriages), Nagalingam (God who gives offsprings), Pasupatheeswarar (God who showers wealth), and Pillayar (Lord of Wisdom).</p>



<p>The idol of Ganesha is decorated in different ways depending on the day of the week. It could on days be Gold or just a simple Dhoti on others.</p>



<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the major festivals celebrated here in a grand manner. The ceremonies begin 9 days before the festival and last 10 days after. Devotees from all over visit the temple to attend the Car Festival.</p>



<p><strong>6. Shree Vinayaka Devaru Temple, Idagunji, Karnataka</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6829 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shree-Vinayaka-Devaru-Temple-sandeepskulkarniblogspotcom.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6829" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shree-Vinayaka-Devaru-Temple-sandeepskulkarniblogspotcom.jpg 800w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shree-Vinayaka-Devaru-Temple-sandeepskulkarniblogspotcom-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shree-Vinayaka-Devaru-Temple-sandeepskulkarniblogspotcom-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;freepressjournal</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>501 kms and 9 hours drive from Bangalore and 173 kms and 4 hours from Mangalore, the Vinayaka Devaru Temple in Idagunji was built in the 4th Century.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Afraid of the terror, the Kali Yuga, would bring, sages had started performing rituals imploring to Lord Krishna to redeem them. Their rituals though faced obstacles throughout, on the suggestion of Narada (the divine sage) who suggested they pray to Ganesha (the remover of obstacles). They gathered on the bank of River Sharavathi, at Kunjavana asking Ganesha to intervene, singing him hymns and praises. Pleased by their devotion, Ganesha decided to remain at the place and help them conduct their rituals without difficulties. The lake there was then named Ganesha-Tirtha and supplied water to the temple.</p>



<p>The central idol in the temple is that of a Ganesha with two arms standing on a stone slab, wearing a yagnopavita (sacred thread) and a necklace of small bells.</p>



<p><strong>7. Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple, Pune</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6830" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3.jpg 1280w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maxresdefault-3-850x478.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>160 kms and 3 hours away from Mumbai is Pune’s Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>A Halwai (Sweet Maker) from Latur, Dagdusheth moved to Pune and opened his sweet shop- Kaka Halwai near Datta Mandir. He was quite successful and emerged into being a rich businessman. During the plague epidemic in the late 1880’s Dagdusheth lost his son. This led him and his wife into depression. For them to heal themselves, Shri Madhavnath Maharaj recommended them to build a Ganesh Temple. Lokmanya Tilak was a contemporary of Dagdusheth, and he gave fruition to his idea of a public gathering during Ganesh Chaturthi here.</p>



<p>Adorned with 40 kilos of gold, the Ganesha idol in the temple is 2.2 metres tall and 1 metre wide. The Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at this temple involve a 10-day pompous ceremony to which devotees from all across Maharashtra flood. While it may be a crowded affair, participating in the ceremony is a must-do.</p>



<p><strong>8. Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple, Jaipur, Rajasthan</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6831 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6831" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance.jpg 2592w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 2592px) 100vw, 2592px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;rajasthantourismbuzz</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>The Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple in Tilak Nagar is about 7 kms and a 10-minute drive away from Jaipur city centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Built-in 1761 atop Moti Dungri Hill, the idol at this temple is said to be over 500 years old. It was bought to Jaipur from Udaipur by Seth Jai Ram Paliwal who built the temple. An iconic image of Ganesha, the idol is Sindoor coloured and has a rightward turning trunk. The structure of the temple is simple and beautiful. Built in the Nagara style and based on the model of a Scottish Castle. It was built in only 4 months using limestone and marble.</p>



<p>A fair is organized at the temple every Wednesday. The temple also hosts a Shiva Lingam, entry to which is only permitted once a year during Mahashivratri.</p>



<p><strong>9. Ganesh Tok, Gangtok, Sikkim</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-6832"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6832" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok.jpg 1600w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption>A 4-hour and 124 kms drive from Siliguri, Ganeshtok Temple in Gangtok is a must visit!  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Situated on a small hill, the temple is so tiny that it can accommodate only one person at a time, who also has to crawl his way on all fours, through the narrow passage that leads to the temple. It is believed that wishes made here are fulfilled. What makes the drive and visit all the more beautiful is the view from the hill. It offers a birds-eye view of the city, the snow-clad Kanchenjunga and if you go during the monsoons and are lucky enough, you may be able to see clouds floating below you.</p>



<p>Next to the temple is also Smriti Van. It is a place where devotees can plant a sapling on behalf of their loved ones. Also around is Hanuman Tok, a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman.</p>



<p><strong>10. Ganpatyar Temple, Srinagar, Jammu &amp; Kashmir</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6833" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex.jpg 580w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex-413x244.jpg 413w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>The Ganpatyar Temple in Srinagar is an approximately 600 kms drive from Chandigarh or Ludhiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Said to be the oldest Ganesh idol, the sculpture of Ganpati at this temple was thrown into River Jhelum by the Pathan rulers. It was later lifted out from the river and reinstalled into the temple. It is also considered the place where Lord Ganesha himself assures the sage Kashyap of having a settlement of people in Kashmir. It is also known as the Siddhi Vinayak Ganesh Mandir.</p>



<p><strong>11. Karunya Mahaganapathi Temple, New Delhi</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6834" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya.jpg 736w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>12 kms and a 20-minute drive from central Delhi, the Karunya Mahaganapathi Temple is located in Mayur Vihar Phase 2 in New Delhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Since its establishment in 1987 by a few people, the Karunya Mahaganapathi Mandir has grown over the years. From a simple shrine with a Ganesh idol to a well-built temple in the South Indian style, the shrine has grown. All festivals are celebrated with extreme fervour at the temple, and so is Ganesh Chaturthi. Its easily accessible location makes it a must visit if you are in Delhi.</p>



<p><strong>12. Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai, Maharashtra</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6835" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565.jpg 665w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>Located in the heart of main Mumbai, the Siddhivinayak Temple built in 1801 is one of the richest temples in Mumbai.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>A rich Agri childless woman, Deubai Patil, funded the construction of the Siddhivinayak Temple. She did so, so that Lord may grant children to other barren women. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj buried two divine idols near the presiding deity on orders by his Guru, Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth. Just as Swami Samarth prophesied, 21 years after it a Madar Tree grew through the spot with Svayambhu (self-manifested) Ganesha in its branches.</p>



<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the grandest manner at this temple which also happens to be a part of Ashtavinayaka, the eight Ganpati Temple circuit around Pune and Mumbai in Maharashtra. While it may be a crowded day at the temple, the experience is worth it.</p>



<p>Now that you know the different places you could visit this Ganesh Chaturthi, all you need to do is make up your mind. Book a Zoomcar from your city and enjoy a drive with your friends and family to these spiritually enriching temples. Take a break from your routine and let the almighty rejuvenate you. Also, do not forget to let us know where you’re Zooming to!</p>

Convenient and quick as they are, bicycles are the perfect ammunition to run speedy errands. Whether you need that medicine urgently or are craving ice-cream in the middle of the night. Always at your disposal, no rocket science involved. Hop on and PEDL.</p>



<p><strong>2) Find your way through the traffic</strong><br>
Bicycles are lovely! They’re portable and convenient and of course lighter than your motorbike. So if you’re stuck in the perpetual city traffic just scoot your way through!<br>
Hack: In a haste and stuck at the red light, pick your bicycle up and just cross the street walking. Get some “Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai” feels.</p>



<p>(We do not recommend breaking traffic rules under any circumstance though)</p>



<p><strong>3) I park, where I park!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
Parking a bicycle does not occupy a lot of space. So even if you’re in a public space, the chances of your parked bicycle causing an obstruction to passers-by are bleak. And if parking in your residential colony is a concern, you can always park inside your home!</p>



<p><strong>4) <strong>What’s more romantic than a cycling date?</strong> </strong><br>Want to do something fun and not cliche on your date? Go on a cycling date to a nearby park or hill. The exhaustion from cycling and the lovely view and wind should for sure put you both in a very cuddly space. Amazing photographs for perks! Note: Your date lasts longer!</p>



<p><strong>5) <strong><strong>Lose those extra Kgs doing something fun!</strong></strong></strong><br>Going to the gym is a task in itself and none of us can deny the boredom a staple routine brings. A fantastic way to reach your health goals by simply picking a better alternative in your day to day life without having to spare extra hours is a god sent! Find a way to replace one of your mode of transports during to the day to a bicycle. Not only will it help you sweat it out, you will also love the experience and genuinely look forward to it.</p>



<p><strong>6) <strong><strong><strong>Earn Karma Points</strong></strong></strong></strong><br>We all are well aware of how we need to move towards being more conscious beings with our choices. Burning fuel only intensifies the pressure we’re exuding on Mother Earth. Wherever you have a choice opt for clean travelling and earn yourself some good karma. </p>



<p><strong>7) <strong><strong><strong><strong>Sasta, sundar, tikau!</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br>If you own a vehicle you know the burning a hole in your pocket isn’t a one-time occurrence. It’s maintenance, fuel, parking cost, are a perpetual hole in your pocket. Maintaining a bicycle costs a fraction of the price as compared that a motorbike and no fuel or parking fuss. Also, you don’t even need to buy a bicycle, you can just rent a PEDL and you’re sorted. Not only do you save on a lot of expenditure while you PEDL, you can now also earn as you PEDL! With ‘One Love, One PEDL’ the more you ride, the more you earn. 5 people/day stand a chance to win up to Rs. 500 PayTM cash daily and Travel vouchers worth Rs. 15,000. That’s not all; the top 2 riders stand a chance to win a One Plus 6! (Could be the perfect phone camera to take for your cycling date!) PEDL brings you a smart, affordable and environment-friendly way to take the road with its rentable bicycles. You can pick one up from your nearest PEDL station and drop it any around you. With its cost-efficient and smart, seamless payments, PEDL is the revolution of clean travel. Begin your PEDL journey now!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road to Independence was certainly not an easy one for India. It took effort and sacrifices from countless martyrs and civilians whom we celebrate today. Let&#8217;s take a walk down some memorable roads that you could plan a drive to, and let the patriotism hit you right in the feels.</span></p>



<p><strong>Mumbai, Hutatma Chowk</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6785 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6785" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211; Flickr</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in the busy business quarters of Fort. Hutatma Chowk derives its name from an incident of the past where the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was fired upon by the police during a peaceful protest leading to 105 deaths. &nbsp;A statue of a &#8220;Martyr with a Flame&#8221; next to the Flora Fountain stands as a memorial to the martyrs. The Flora Fountain was built in 1860. It was built at a total cost of Rs. 47,000, a large sum in those days. It represents the Roman Goddess Flora, the Goddess of Abundance. The Fountain is an intricately sculpted piece of art and a historical monument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rajpath (meaning &#8220;King&#8217;s Way&#8221;) is a ceremonial boulevard stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President&#8217;s home) on Raisina Hills through Vijay Chowk and India Gate to National Stadium. The annual Republic Day parade takes place on 26 January on Rajpath. Considered one of the most important roads in India, the avenue is lined on both sides by huge lawns, canals, and rows of trees.</span></p>

<p><strong>Pune, Maneckji Mehta Road </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally Staunton Road, named after Francis Staunton a British captain, who led the troops in the Battle of Koregaon Bhima where the Marathas were defeated. Maneckji Mehta Road has been laid out by the British East India Company and subsequently by the British Army in a grid-like fashion, with almost military precision. Roads turn at right-angles and modifications are appropriate at places where artillery and soldiers were stationed.</span></p>

</div>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India houses hundreds of such roads that hold heritage and a tale to tell. Just like our road to freedom. This Independence Day take a drive down these lanes and relive the feeling of Independence. And of course, don&#8217;t let the absence of a vehicle stop you, we&#8217;re here! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know of any such roads in your city, let us know!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you pass through life you realise how important time is, how fleeting it is and how necessary it is to spend it doing things that provide to fulfilling your major responsibilities in life. Though these responsibilities may differ from person to person, there is one more aspect we need to cater to that we tend to miss out on; ourselves. Now you may spend 8-10 hours a day at work and it may leave you burnt out, but that time between checking out from work and hitting the bed is yours! You are the one in absolute control and its you who decides what to with it.</span></p>



<p>While it may be easy for you to just get home and watch Netflix, there’s so much, so much more you could do. Let us help you get started with a few &#8211;</p>



<p><strong>Ditch the route and stray away to new roads.</strong></p>



<p>Let the love of the wheels guide you, and take you through an undiscovered path. What you could end up discovering is beyond predictable. A lovely little street vendor selling the best pakodas, a group of young kids playing cricket, or just some peaceful serene time. There’s so much to learn from observing people and when you’re only using the power in your daily environment you’re only half exploring it.</p>



<p><strong>Take the family out for a drive</strong></p>



<p>While everything you do, may be to provide for their life necessities, they also need to spend some quality time with you. Surprise them with a long drive plan after work today. Take them out, play the music they love and have dinner together. The happiness would be leaps more than even watching the finale of the much loved series.</p>



<p><strong>Visit that friend you’ve not seen in a while</strong></p>



<p>We all know the drill of planning to meet them over text every week and then letting work and life get in the way from that time you both deserve. So today, drive up to them and make it finally happen. You owe it to yourself to spend some self-indulging time with those you love and those who love you. In case you’re confused on what you could do, make sure you read our blog on Movies that you could watch with your friends (hyperlink)</p>



<p><strong>Go out on a date with your partner</strong></p>



<p>Love need not be limited to the weekends. Ask them out for dinner or a movie they’ve been wanting to watch. Take them shopping or just drive them to that peaceful place you discovered and rediscover it with them. Shower them with all the attention and love they deserve from you.</p>



<p><strong>Hit the gym or start a physical activity</strong></p>



<p>If you really want to give yourself back, you may want to start doing something for your physical health. Today’s sedentary lifestyle makes it really difficult for you to have a fit body. Now this may require you stretching your usual limits a little, it will be worth every bit! Join a gym or fitness centre or simply start playing that sport you love again. (No, we do not mean PUBG)</p>



<p>Well, these are just some basics to get you started. We’d love to be a part of making your life better at every step. For the ease of travel and to make your weekday plans hassle free with Zoom Commute. Your car for 5 work days of the week. No local transport or cab struggle.</p>



<p>Have the car and use it as per your convenience for 5 days a week starting at just ₹560/day.</p>



<p>Travel to and fro from work, but don’t do just that. Do a lot more. #LiveAfter5</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and friendship are a human&#8217;s anchor through the tumultuous storm called &#8216;life&#8217;. As you casually pass through your journey you see this person sailing through theirs and your head goes, &#8220;Hey mate, you could use some life-support, and this looks like an apt candidate!&#8221;. Unlike most missed romantic first-chances, you do not let this go. You see them sitting next to you in school, or across the table in the college canteen. You see them eating your favorite dish at the restaurant, or overhear them speaking of the football club you love. And before you know it you&#8217;re crying to them at 3AM about how you sacrificed your last toffee for a girl you liked when you were 5.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friendship is undeniably a major moving force in ones life. You were dodging the 8 PM traffic on SV Road all alone. Now you&#8217;re moving steady, at 60 kmph on a lovely highway with your mates singing “Yaad karegi duniya, tera mera afsana”. </span></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/12-6fcbe416b9439f4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6761" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/12-6fcbe416b9439f4.jpg 600w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/12-6fcbe416b9439f4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bollywood has, over the years, portrayed friendships in the most adorable, envy-worthy manner. We put down our 5 all-time favorite on-the-move friendship movies (just in case you want to have a movie night with the gang).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving through the virgin streets of Spain, the boy trio redefined friendship in movies. The movie showcased the simplistic manner in which life unfolds. How over the span of a road trip fences mend, wounds heal, love happens and the worst fears are overcome. Watch it for the life lessons and intermittent doses of melodrama; and of course great music.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6762" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finding-fanny1-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting vacation goals for entire generation, and seeding the Goa love was Dil Chahta Hai. A Bollywood gem based on the most inevitable phases of life. We&#8217;re sure someone in your troop is the real-life counterpart of the carefree Akash, lover boy Sameer or artsy Sid. The beauty of the film is in how it remains relatable over years, they don&#8217;t just call it the Bible of Friendship you see.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one could be a hit or miss! Based in the more silent and serene parts of Goa, Finding Fanny is an unusual film. Unusual misfit characters thrown together due to an unusual happening. As they proceed through the road-trip, you fall in love with the characters and their quirks, their journey and destinations. The beauty of Goa, a bunch of talented actors and a short sweet film.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is seeing the times of an ‘Airpocalypse’. You’d agree that we need a change and we thought of taking the first step to enable you to a greener alternative, one step at a time and we could make a change. Here’s presenting you an electric vehicle at a price point which won’t burn a hole in your pocket.</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZAP Subscribe lets you get all the benefits of owning an Electric Vehicle without the hassle of buying one. Let go of the car down payment worries, heavy monthly EMIs and everything else it brings along.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVs or Electric Vehicles&nbsp;are automobiles that work on a rechargeable battery system, letting go of the conventional fuel utilizing ways. This results in them being more efficient and cleaner in terms of air pollution and greenhouse emissions. They leave a drastically lighter carbon footprint in comparison to conventional cars. They may sound novel at the moment, but they are what we all need; you, us and the environment.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-background" style="background-color: #6cbe45;" href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Subscribe A CAR</strong></a></div>
<div class="wp-block-button alignleft is-style-fill"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6743" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10.jpg 1251w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/E20_LP_001-10-10-850x425.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZoomCar and ZAP Subscribe bring you the Mahindra Electric e2O plus. Assuring a driving range of approximately 110-120 km per charge, the Mahindra Electric e2O plus is the Urban Indian Man&#8217;s best bet! With Direct Drive Transmission and a small turning radius, it is apt for your city traffic. You can be assured you aren&#8217;t harming the environment since you emit absolutely nothing from your tailpipe and utilize no fuel at all.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s solve some concerns you may have about having an EV</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><b>Do I need to buy an EV?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They aren&#8217;t cheap. When seeing alternatives you would definitely opt for a regular car that would cost you nearly the same and give you more space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><b>Car Financing?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that would mean innumerous Car Loan and Car EMI Calculations, a lot of research time and some added stress to your already stressful lifestyle. The High-Cost EMIs and Car Loan Interests would still be a perpetual nemesis even after you’ve received your vehicle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><b>What is the Resale-value of EV?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EV is not a profitable commodity. You may not be able to resell it at the same, let alone a higher price than what you paid when you bought it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><b>Is managing and maintaining an EV difficult?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to what you may believe, EV may sound novel but ZAP Subscribe Assistance helps you simplify the not-so-complicated process.</span></p>



</span>
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-background" style="background-color: #6cbe45;" href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Subscribe to the e2O!</strong></a></div>
<div class="wp-block-button alignleft is-style-fill"></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><b>What if I need to go on a long road trip?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>Your EV is your daily use urban vehicle that helps you travel short to medium distances. When it comes to going on longer trips, a single charge would practically not be able to take you to your destination and bring you back. For times like these, you have a plethora of self-drive Zoomcars at your disposal. Just rent a car with us. We offer you a <strong>flat 50% off</strong> on your fare since you’re a responsible driver with no terms and condition whatsoever! <br><br>EVs are the future of automobiles. Soon enough they’ll be a need and not a matter of choice. You could be an early entrant to the bandwagon of individuals who responded to symptoms of the Airpocalypse in time. Given the simplicity of the process, there’s no reason you would not want to opt for one. Have more concerns or want to get started now?</span></p>
