<p>Harsh Pamnani is a brand storyteller. His bestselling book series Booming Brands, covering inspiring journeys of new-age ‘Made in India’ brands, is published by CNBC. Besides, he has written 70 plus articles in publications such as Forbes. In Booming Brands Volume -2, he covered the journey of Zoomcar. We caught up in a quick chat with him to discuss his book series and why he chose Zoomcar’s story. Excerpts from the conversation: </p>



<p><strong>WHAT MADE YOU WRITE BOOMING BRANDS?</strong></p>



<p>Since childhood, I have been curious to understand how a few entrepreneurs create admirable brands while many struggle. To satisfy my curiosity, I have read numerous biographies and case studies.</p>



<p>One of the problems with these resources was that they were filled with American examples. Every market is different. The brand-building strategies, which worked in developed markets like America, may not work in developing markets like India. Some literature is available around Indian corporates, but many large corporates were born in the pre-liberalization and pre-digital era, and have grown over the decades. Their approaches might not be directly applicable to many businesses of the new era. Moreover, I had interacted with many professionals, MBA students, and professors, who expressed that they want to know in detail about the journeys of new-age Indian brands like Zoomcar. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Noticing this void, I felt I could create a resource that could be leveraged by people interested in understanding how new age ‘Made in India’ brands are getting created.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO INCLUDE ZOOMCAR AS A CASE STUDY IN YOUR BOOK?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Zoomcar is a pioneer. It has created the category of self-drive car rental service in India. By becoming an intermediary between car owners and consumers who don&#8217;t know each other, Zoomcar is not only facilitating an economic exchange, cost savings, and convenience, but also enabling environmental benefits on a large scale.</p>



<p>Personally speaking, Mr. Greg Moran’s journey has inspired me a lot. I admire how he identified an enormous opportunity in India, dropped out of a top business school in America, came to a new country, fought multiple challenges, and built a popular brand.&nbsp; Besides, the kind of innovations Zoomcar has introduced and the kind of employee development programs it has started are commendable.</p>



<p>Additionally, the stories of Indians like Vinod Khosla and Sabeer Bhatia, who moved from India to Silicon Valley and founded companies like Sun Microsystems and Hotmail, are very popular. But the inspiring stories of Americans who moved to India and made their mark here are mostly unheard of. This is one such story, and I wanted to take it to the masses.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT ZOOMCAR’S STORYTELLING? WHY SHOULD CONSUMERS, STUDENTS &amp; THE START-UP ECOSYSTEM KNOW MORE ABOUT IT?</strong></p>



<p>As you can imagine, in today&#8217;s crowded market, when customers&#8217; attention span is short, creating brand awareness is a difficult task. Interestingly, Zoomcar stands out in a crowded market. I think, Zoomcar&#8217;s interesting experiments, innovations, and campaigns have become sources of numerous stories that have played an instrumental role in popularizing the brand.</p>



<p>For instance, when Zoomcar started, car vendors charged an absurd amount of deposit money while giving a car on rent. However, Zoomcar made it possible with only Rs. 5,000 refundable deposit. &nbsp;Around Friendship Day, Zoomcar replicated a car from the movie called &#8216;Dumb and Dumber.&#8217; This car named ‘K9 Cruiser’ looked like a dog and was taken around many cities. Also, during Ganesh Chaturthi, Zoomcar created a car that looked like a mouse, and they called it ‘Mushak’. Amusingly, the Zoomcar team listed a horse named ‘Dhanno’ and an auto on the platform. Interestingly, these experiments gave birth to many stories and contributed to a lot of word of mouth.</p>



<p>Also, Zoomcar’s YouTube music video that conveys the story of a group of friends who use Zoomcar for their next trip became viral and connected people with the brand. Then, Zoomcar’s partnership with digital channel Filter Copy for a web series – &#8216;What The Folks&#8217; made the brand very popular among youngsters. Besides, your ZAP Subscribe TV advertisements have also been very catchy.</p>



<p><strong>HOW HAS THE RESPONSE TO THE BOOK BEEN TO DATE?</strong></p>



<p>Booming Brands has received a tremendous response. I would like to express my gratitude to leaders like Mr. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Nestle India; Mr. Sunil Kant Munjal, Chairman, Hero Enterprise; Prof. Rishikesha Krishnan, Director, IIM Bangalore; Mr. Harsh Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises; Ms. Samina Hamied, Executive Vice Chairperson, Cipla and others who gave me their precious testimonials.</p>



<p>I am very grateful to CNBC TV18 for publishing my book. I received great feedback from many marketing professors from prestigious business schools. For example, Booming Brands was released at XLRI, Jamshedpur, and professors of international business schools such as Prof. Kartik Hosanagar and Prof. David Bell from Wharton, and Prof. Anand Narasimhan from IMD have appreciated Booming Brands. Recently, the Marketing and Advertising Club at Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSoM), IIT Kharagpur, also appreciated Booming Brands!</p>



<p><strong>WHAT HAVE BEEN YOUR LEARNINGS AS AN AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS NOW, ESPECIALLY ON THE PUBLICITY &amp; MARKETING SIDE?</strong></p>



<p>Content is the king! People love stories. Readers found stories in Booming Brands helpful, and that led to a lot of word of mouth. Further, tweets by leaders like Mr. Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, Government of India, and Mr. Harsh Mariwala, Chairman of Marico, helped a lot. Also, coverage by reputed media platforms was beneficial.</p>

<p><em><strong>Changing times call for making new and better choices. And, considering that the current phase is one marked by a sense of insecurity, you need to make decisive choices that ensure the safety of your loved ones and yourself.</strong></em></p>



<p>Travelling is one such key aspect of life, which requires you to choose from various alternatives. However, when travelling relates to your daily commute, you generally get used to your preferred choices and do not consider making any changes. For instance, those of you who do not have a personal vehicle would have never earlier given a second thought before hopping on a means of public transport or hailing a cab. However, now things are not as simple as before. With social distancing and constant vigilance becoming the new normal, questions like how and with whom you travel, have become significant concerns.</p>



<p>That is why, now, when it comes to choosing the right means to travel, many of you may be in a dilemma. So far, you may have based all your choices on factors like convenience and affordability. But what about the present and the future, both of which are mired with risk?</p>



<h3><strong>Safety is Priority Now</strong></h3>



<p>Keeping the current scenario in mind where there is no cure for Coronavirus yet, safety and prevention need to be given utmost priority now. That is why, you must choose an option that offers you maximum safety against the risk of contracting the virus.</p>



<p>So, to help you understand which means of commuting is the safest for you, let’s take a look at the different options that may be available to you:</p>



<h3><strong>Public Transport</strong></h3>



<p>So far, maybe you were commuting to your office or other places through a means of public transport such as the bus or metro train. Reason being that it is economical. However, considering that social distancing is the need of the times, using public transport will not be a wise choice now, if you fear your family’s security. There is an increased vulnerability of coming in contact with infected people and virus-ridden objects in such transport systems, given the number of people who use it.</p>



<h3><strong>Cabs or Taxis</strong></h3>



<p>Over the last few years, some of you may have gotten used to the idea of using driver ridden cabs to reach places. You booked the cab; it arrived, and off you went with the driver. You were choosing this means because it offered comfort. However, now given the nature of virus transmission, every aspect and encounter during travel matters, for you never know what may expose you to increased risk. Cab drivers drive many people in a day, and so you can never be sure of who they come in contact with before they meet you. From the exchange of currency to the virus-ridden car, cabs or taxis may not be as safe as you may think them to be.</p>



<h3><strong>Car Pooling</strong></h3>



<p>If you were car-pooling till a few months ago, you might be proud of making a wise choice with regards to upholding the idea of shared mobility. However, cut to the present, and now there is a complete shift in the narrative. Now, due to prevalent risk, shared mobility is going to be unsafe, for it exposes you to the risk of transmission. So, now the times call for being responsible by following social distancing norms while travelling so that both you and others in your environment can stay safe.</p>



<h3><strong>Office Cabs</strong></h3>



<p>So far, those of you whose companies provided office cabs may have considered yourself among the lucky few. You had no worries about commuting to the office daily. However, now with so much fear of virus transmission around us and no antidote been discovered so far, you may be in a dilemma if you should continue using it or not. While the choice is yours to make, but remember that you cannot keep a check on who all did the cab pick and drop during the day.</p>



<h3><strong>Personal Mobility Options: The Safest Means</strong></h3>



<p>In these uncertain times, personal mobility has come across as the safest way to commute around. It allows social distancing, which is an effective way to minimize the risk of transmission and to stay safe. One option of personal mobility is commuting through your personal vehicle, for you can travel alone or with your family, away from the crowds.</p>



<p>However, if you do not have a personal car, then what other choice do you have? Let us tell you of a solution that can very well take care of your safety needs in these unprecedented times.</p>



<h3><strong>Self-Drive Rental Car</strong></h3>



<p>Buying a car may or may not be a feasible option for you, especially during such a period of crisis. However, what you can easily avail instead is a <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>self-drive car rental</strong></a> facility that will provide you with the same benefits as you can get with a personal vehicle. It means when you book a rental car, you get access to a safe travel experience that keeps risk and fear both at bay.</p>



<p>We, at Zoomcar, offer self-drive cars that are thoroughly sanitized and are delivered to your doorstep. In these critical times, where safety has become the topmost priority for all commuters, we believe that our services will offer considerable support to all those who are looking for personal mobility solutions. We offer our services in two ways, namely: i) Rental services, and ii) Subscription services</p>



<p><strong>i) Self-Drive Car on Rent</strong></p>



<p>If you commute occasionally and are looking for the safest way to drive your way around, then taking a car on rent can help you. It will give you access to a safe and sanitized self-driven vehicle whenever and for whatever time you want. We provide everything from weekly or <strong>monthly car rental</strong> facilities to even <strong>one-way car rental</strong> options. You can make the <strong>online car booking</strong> depending on your unique commuting needs, and the rental car will arrive within 30 minutes.</p>



<p>Whether you want to commute around to get multiple errands done, need to drop your family member to a particular place or have a doctor’s appointment, book a Zoomcar on rent and keep your safety in check by commuting in a sanitized, self-driven car.</p>



<p><strong>ii) Self-Drive Car on Subscription</strong></p>



<p>If you want to secure your travel plans for a more extended period, then our <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe"><strong>car on subscription</strong></a> services could be the best solution for you and your family. The most significant benefit of taking a monthly or <strong>half-yearly car subscription</strong> is that it allows you to enjoy continued access to a safe way of travelling.</p>



<p>Taking a <strong>car on a subscription</strong> facility enables you to enjoy the same benefits as you would with your personal vehicle, just in a much more affordable way. Subscription car service as provided by us, at Zoomcar does not require you to make any down payment at the time of booking. Moreover, all our cars are not just sanitized, but also insured, meaning you can be sure about your security in case you meet with any untoward happening while en route to your destination. Also, you will not even have to incur any repair and maintenance costs at your end. All you will need to do is make the booking and pay the subscription charges.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Lord of Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles- Vigneshwara, the God of prosperity, wisdom, wealth and knowledge- Vinayaka, Lord Ganesha. Also known as Ganpati- the Lord of People, Ganesha holds a supreme position among the Hindu Gods and lots of adoration and love from the people. His charming, friendly and forgiving nature makes him a favourite of kids and adults alike.</p>



<p>The son of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha was created by his mother to guard her house while she bathed. She was looking for someone who would devoutly protect her, and when she failed to think of anyone, she created her son Ganesha from the turmeric (used for bathing) from her body. Parvati demanded of Lord Brahma that Ganpati be brought back to life and worshipped before all other Gods after Shiva beheaded him (that is how Ganesha got his elephant-head).</p>



<p>The birthday of the people’s God, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated all over India with a lot of pomp and devotion. Multitudes of devotees offer their respects in their own fashion. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi has many variations across states. Ganesh Temples are magnificently decorated, aartis are sung, offerings are made. If you’ve been to a Ganesh Pandal or Temple during Ganesh Chaturthi you have undoubtedly felt the aura and power of strong-willed devotion, unwavering faith and belief in God surround you.</p>



<p>If it’s been a while since you felt the feeling, head out this Ganesh Chaturthi with your friends and family. It’ll be a lovely spiritual outing and an experience for you as a family that you will make memories at and can tell stories of. We’ve listed down some Ganesh Temples in India you could visit this Ganesh Chaturthi.</p>

<p><strong>1. Arulmigu Ucchi Pillaiyar Temple, Rockfort, Trichy, Tamil Nadu</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6824 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6824" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02.jpg 900w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rock_fort_trichy_02-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;http://www.tajtravelstrichy.com/</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Located in Rockfort, Trichy approximately 329 kms and a 6-hour drive from Chennai, Arulmigu Ucchi Pillaiyar Temple was made in the 7th Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>History believes the rock on which this temple stands in the place where Lord Ganesha disguised as a kid ran from King Vibhishana after installing the Ranganathaswamy deity in Srirangam. When Vibhishan ran to follow this kid, he climbed on a rock. Vibhishana hit him on the forehead, and that is when the child revealed himself as Ganesha. A dent can still be seen in the idol of Ganesha at this temple.</p>



<p>Made by the Pallavas and Nayaks the temple is now maintained by the Archeological Department of India. Placed atop a rock, with stairs leading to the shrine, the temple offers a beautiful view of Trichy, Srirangam and the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam.</p>



<p>On the same rock is also a Siva Temple. You could also stop to visit the Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam which is only 4 kms and a 20-minute drive away from Ucchi Pillaiyar. You could visit the temple’s website for more information.</p>



<p><strong>2. Sri Swayambhu Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Devastanam, Kanipakam, Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6825 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6825" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2.jpg 512w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/com.www_.KanipakamVarasiddiVinayakaTemple_2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;androidappsapk</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>Approximately 177 kms and a 5-hour drive from Bangalore the Vinayaka Temple in Chittoor was built in the 11th Century.  </strong></em></p>



<p>The idol at this Ganesha temple is Swayambhu (self-manifested). It was revealed to 3 blind, deaf and dumb farmers who were digging up the dried out well for water. When their equipment hit the idol, it oozed out blood and flooded the river. This blood healed them of their deformities. The original idol is still at the temple and the springs of the well eternal. The water from these springs is offered to devotees as holy water. The idol is also said to be growing in size. A Silver Armour offered to the idol by a devotee 50 years ago, no longer fits it.</p>



<p>The temple here was built by the Chola Dynasty King Kulothunga Chola I and the work was further expanded by the Vijayanagara Dynasty.</p>



<p><strong>3. Sri Maha Ganapathy Temple, HMT Kalamassery, Kochi, Kerala</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>A 21.4 km and approximately 45 minutes drive via the Kochi Panvel Highway, the Mahaganapathy Temple was built in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Built by a pious Late Mr N Ragunatha Menon and his children who lived in Kalamassery, the Mahaganapathy Temple also houses shrines to Subramaniam, the Navgrahas, Shiva, Parvathi, Rama, Dakshinamurthi and Chandikeshwara. The temple has a simple style of construction and has no outer walls. A Peepal tree stands in front of the Ganapathy Shrine. How close it is the busy Eloor-Kalamassery Road has also earned the diety the name of ‘Roadside Ganapathy’.</p>



<p><strong>4. Shree Dodda Ganapathi Temple, Bull Temple Rd, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6826" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695.jpg 1600w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSC01695-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>A 6 km and 25-minute drive from Bangalore, the Dodda Ganapathi Temple was built in the 16th Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>The Dodda Ganapathi Temple is right next to the Bull Temple/Nandi Temple. It houses a large idol of Ganesha. The temple is adorned in different ways of decoration throughout the week. One of the interesting ones being the Benne Alankara or butter coating on the idol. About 100 kgs of butter is used for the same. The devotees at this temple also believe that the idol grows in size every year.</p>



<p>The temple surroundings are quiet and beautiful, and the experience of visiting the temple is a powerful one. While there you can, of course, visit the Nandi Temple close by, another must visit is the Bugle Rock Park.</p>



<p><strong>5. Karpaka Vinayakar, Pillayarpatti, Tiruppathur Taluk, Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu</strong></p>

The temple also houses rock cut sculptures of Lord Shiva, Karthiyayini (Goddess who arranges marriages), Nagalingam (God who gives offsprings), Pasupatheeswarar (God who showers wealth), and Pillayar (Lord of Wisdom).</p>

<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the major festivals celebrated here in a grand manner. The ceremonies begin 9 days before the festival and last 10 days after. Devotees from all over visit the temple to attend the Car Festival.</p>

<p><strong>501 kms and 9 hours drive from Bangalore and 173 kms and 4 hours from Mangalore, the Vinayaka Devaru Temple in Idagunji was built in the 4th Century.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Afraid of the terror, the Kali Yuga, would bring, sages had started performing rituals imploring to Lord Krishna to redeem them. Their rituals though faced obstacles throughout, on the suggestion of Narada (the divine sage) who suggested they pray to Ganesha (the remover of obstacles). They gathered on the bank of River Sharavathi, at Kunjavana asking Ganesha to intervene, singing him hymns and praises. Pleased by their devotion, Ganesha decided to remain at the place and help them conduct their rituals without difficulties. The lake there was then named Ganesha-Tirtha and supplied water to the temple.</p>



<p>The central idol in the temple is that of a Ganesha with two arms standing on a stone slab, wearing a yagnopavita (sacred thread) and a necklace of small bells.</p>



<p><strong>7. Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple, Pune</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>160 kms and 3 hours away from Mumbai is Pune’s Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>A Halwai (Sweet Maker) from Latur, Dagdusheth moved to Pune and opened his sweet shop- Kaka Halwai near Datta Mandir. He was quite successful and emerged into being a rich businessman. During the plague epidemic in the late 1880’s Dagdusheth lost his son. This led him and his wife into depression. For them to heal themselves, Shri Madhavnath Maharaj recommended them to build a Ganesh Temple. Lokmanya Tilak was a contemporary of Dagdusheth, and he gave fruition to his idea of a public gathering during Ganesh Chaturthi here.</p>



<p>Adorned with 40 kilos of gold, the Ganesha idol in the temple is 2.2 metres tall and 1 metre wide. The Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at this temple involve a 10-day pompous ceremony to which devotees from all across Maharashtra flood. While it may be a crowded affair, participating in the ceremony is a must-do.</p>



<p><strong>8. Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple, Jaipur, Rajasthan</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6831 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6831" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance.jpg 2592w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/moti-doongri-ganesh-temple-entrance-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 2592px) 100vw, 2592px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211;&nbsp;rajasthantourismbuzz</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>The Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple in Tilak Nagar is about 7 kms and a 10-minute drive away from Jaipur city centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Built-in 1761 atop Moti Dungri Hill, the idol at this temple is said to be over 500 years old. It was bought to Jaipur from Udaipur by Seth Jai Ram Paliwal who built the temple. An iconic image of Ganesha, the idol is Sindoor coloured and has a rightward turning trunk. The structure of the temple is simple and beautiful. Built in the Nagara style and based on the model of a Scottish Castle. It was built in only 4 months using limestone and marble.</p>



<p>A fair is organized at the temple every Wednesday. The temple also hosts a Shiva Lingam, entry to which is only permitted once a year during Mahashivratri.</p>



<p><strong>9. Ganesh Tok, Gangtok, Sikkim</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-6832"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6832" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok.jpg 1600w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ganesh-Tok-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption>A 4-hour and 124 kms drive from Siliguri, Ganeshtok Temple in Gangtok is a must visit!  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Situated on a small hill, the temple is so tiny that it can accommodate only one person at a time, who also has to crawl his way on all fours, through the narrow passage that leads to the temple. It is believed that wishes made here are fulfilled. What makes the drive and visit all the more beautiful is the view from the hill. It offers a birds-eye view of the city, the snow-clad Kanchenjunga and if you go during the monsoons and are lucky enough, you may be able to see clouds floating below you.</p>



<p>Next to the temple is also Smriti Van. It is a place where devotees can plant a sapling on behalf of their loved ones. Also around is Hanuman Tok, a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman.</p>



<p><strong>10. Ganpatyar Temple, Srinagar, Jammu &amp; Kashmir</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6833" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex.jpg 580w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ganpatyar_temple_complex-413x244.jpg 413w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>The Ganpatyar Temple in Srinagar is an approximately 600 kms drive from Chandigarh or Ludhiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Said to be the oldest Ganesh idol, the sculpture of Ganpati at this temple was thrown into River Jhelum by the Pathan rulers. It was later lifted out from the river and reinstalled into the temple. It is also considered the place where Lord Ganesha himself assures the sage Kashyap of having a settlement of people in Kashmir. It is also known as the Siddhi Vinayak Ganesh Mandir.</p>



<p><strong>11. Karunya Mahaganapathi Temple, New Delhi</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6834" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya.jpg 736w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/karunya-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>12 kms and a 20-minute drive from central Delhi, the Karunya Mahaganapathi Temple is located in Mayur Vihar Phase 2 in New Delhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Since its establishment in 1987 by a few people, the Karunya Mahaganapathi Mandir has grown over the years. From a simple shrine with a Ganesh idol to a well-built temple in the South Indian style, the shrine has grown. All festivals are celebrated with extreme fervour at the temple, and so is Ganesh Chaturthi. Its easily accessible location makes it a must visit if you are in Delhi.</p>



<p><strong>12. Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai, Maharashtra</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6835" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565.jpg 665w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/siddhivinayak-temple-mumbai-665x565-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>Located in the heart of main Mumbai, the Siddhivinayak Temple built in 1801 is one of the richest temples in Mumbai.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>A rich Agri childless woman, Deubai Patil, funded the construction of the Siddhivinayak Temple. She did so, so that Lord may grant children to other barren women. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj buried two divine idols near the presiding deity on orders by his Guru, Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth. Just as Swami Samarth prophesied, 21 years after it a Madar Tree grew through the spot with Svayambhu (self-manifested) Ganesha in its branches.</p>



<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the grandest manner at this temple which also happens to be a part of Ashtavinayaka, the eight Ganpati Temple circuit around Pune and Mumbai in Maharashtra. While it may be a crowded day at the temple, the experience is worth it.</p>



<p>Now that you know the different places you could visit this Ganesh Chaturthi, all you need to do is make up your mind. Book a Zoomcar from your city and enjoy a drive with your friends and family to these spiritually enriching temples. Take a break from your routine and let the almighty rejuvenate you. Also, do not forget to let us know where you’re Zooming to!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road to Independence was certainly not an easy one for India. It took effort and sacrifices from countless martyrs and civilians whom we celebrate today. Let&#8217;s take a walk down some memorable roads that you could plan a drive to, and let the patriotism hit you right in the feels.</span></p>



<p><strong>Mumbai, Hutatma Chowk</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6785 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6785" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1502835245_d46ecefa67_b-850x638.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211; Flickr</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in the busy business quarters of Fort. Hutatma Chowk derives its name from an incident of the past where the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was fired upon by the police during a peaceful protest leading to 105 deaths. &nbsp;A statue of a &#8220;Martyr with a Flame&#8221; next to the Flora Fountain stands as a memorial to the martyrs. The Flora Fountain was built in 1860. It was built at a total cost of Rs. 47,000, a large sum in those days. It represents the Roman Goddess Flora, the Goddess of Abundance. The Fountain is an intricately sculpted piece of art and a historical monument.</span></p>

<p>Locals are likely to know the best and cheapest places to shop at in any city. However, Zoomcar is unravelling the best places in Bangalore to shop at under Rs.500 just for you. Yes, you needn’t be a local to know these avenues for we’re spilling the beans for you.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Chickpet</strong></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-6732 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6732" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196.jpg 2400w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dsc0196-850x563.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy &#8211; Bangaloreron</figcaption></figure></div>

So, just trust your instincts and explore the shops based on what appears attractive to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when owning a car was a milestone of one&#8217;s life and the meter to judge his success; only second to owning a home. Thankfully for us though we can have the wheels at our doorstep and our hands on the steering whenever, wherever.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But with this comfort, needs to come responsibility.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are our 6 tips on how you can treat her better than he can,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><b>
</b><b>1) We agree with Shakespeare that “All the world’s your stage”, but believe us all the world is not on the roof of your Zoomcar!</b>

<img class="wp-image-6615 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tumblr_nnq5wiJR4f1u7dw63o4_250-1.gif" alt="" width="451" height="276" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A better, safer and equally fun way to Chaiyya Chaiyya would be to sit inside your Zoomcar, play the song, roll down the windows and move as your non-dancer friend drives. No waste of time, and no human or automobile casualties. Guaranteed.</span>

<b>2) Smoking can make you bimaar, kaafi bimaar</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that tobacco causes 1 death every 6 seconds in India? We do not appreciate smoking in general, but if you still need to, halt for a chai or coffee break. Make sure you do not leave a trace of engaging into this not-so-cool activity. We definitely do not need more Indians to join the 1 million plus bandwagon that lose their lives to tobacco every year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">**cough** Quit **cough**</span><img class="size-full wp-image-6616 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Padmavat.gif" alt="" width="500" height="227" />

<b>3) Do not dreive drukn! </b>

If you just sent an emotionally heavy message to your &#8216;bro&#8217; or &#8216;bae&#8217;, or smashed the DJ because he refused to play &#8216;Kisi disco mein jaaye&#8217; (damn this cool generation) because it was Punjabi night, you definitely do not need to take the wheels. This is the day you&#8217;ve been tolerating that non-drinking friend for all your life!

<img class="size-full wp-image-6617 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3o6wrb28tomtWvgVfa.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But seriously, jokes aside, do not drive drunk. You see there&#8217;s a reason why Daru&#8217;s Badnaam.</span>

<b>4) We do not lend our cars for Bharat&#8217;s Got Talent rehearsals!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We get it, you can drift that car like Vin Diesel did, we believe you at word! Take your Zoomcar on a lovely peaceful long drive, she&#8217;s not big on adventures you see.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not try those stunts and wheelies, your life is just as precious as our car.</span>

<img class="wp-image-6618 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/giphy-1.gif" alt="" width="410" height="175" />

<b>5) Drive responsibly!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the traffic rules and speed limits, chasing cops is not half as fun as it seems in movies; getting caught after that is not at all! Make sure you do not get in trouble, or at least do not invite trouble. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">PS. We do not cover the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bail! </span></i>

<img class="size-full wp-image-6619 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MCZ39lz83o5lC.gif" alt="" width="700" height="375" />

<b>6) What thou hast messed up, thou must tidy!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine stepping into the car you booked smelling like the Burger King kitchen and bodily fluids of your motion-sick friend who couldn&#8217;t aim his puke into the plastic bag. Not a very pleasant sight, honestly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re aiming at creating an eco-system of responsible and considerate individuals. So clean out all the traces of mustard sauce and squeezed coke glasses from the door. Set the bar so high for the next rider that he would want to return the Zoomcar just as clean as he got it!</span>

<img class="size-full wp-image-6620 aligncenter" src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IcGkqdUmYLFGE.gif" alt="" width="400" height="225" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With all those notes taken, you&#8217;re all set to zoom! There&#8217;s  innumerous possibilities, ask that person you&#8217;ve been wanting to take on a drive, make that trip with the gang happen, or just take that early morning long drive to eat those Pakodas you&#8217;ve been wanting to! </span>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Have you realized how over the years our approach to services and products have changed? More and more people today are availing offerings on a subscription basis, be it entertainment or utilities, subscription is the new mantra.</p>
<p>Here are some popular subscription offerings you will resonate with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Video &amp; Music subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You sure have heard of Amazon Prime and Netflix. These popular video-on-demand services offer television shows and films on a subscription basis. Did you ever wonder you could get access to worldwide video content with such ease? These video membership platforms have enabled viewers to subscribe to other network&#8217;s original content effortlessly.</p>
<p>Music streaming has been one of the earliest digital innovations that you would’ve seen – when the cassettes era was toppled by the DVDs and CDs and soon by music streaming services. Saavn and Gaana, for instance, are two such platforms. No hassles of downloading songs, just create your playlist &amp; listen to music on the go.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Food subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Food subscription or in simpler words the dabba system has been around for years now. You’ve must have experienced this in your office where you or your colleague’s lunch (dabba) is delivered each day religiously. This was one of the early subscription models where food would come to you each day at a fee.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Furniture subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Probably a few years ago you never would have thought that you would get furniture on a subscription model. The thought may have only seemed strange. Companies like Furlenco and Rentomojo were incorporated to provide an alternative to buying and selling furniture in rental properties. People living in rented apartments, working long hours who find it inconvenient to equip the house with furniture when they moved, can take furniture on a subscription model.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Book, Articles &amp; Newsletter subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is yet another remarkable change the world has seen. Moving on from hard-bound paper books to an e-book &#8211; digital libraries have given people access to books on a subscription model. Scribd is one such platform. Kindle is yet another innovation, an e-reader that enables users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media without having to buy a physical book.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Toy subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, this is a reality too. Today platforms like Toy Subscription Boxes are available to subscribe to children’s toys on a monthly basis. One can access a wide variety of toys at a subscription fee. This has given parents an opportunity to keep their kids happy while staying away from the clutter and constant demand from the children for new toys.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Introducing Car Subscription</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Zoomcar’s <strong><em>ZAP Subscribe</em></strong>, is a car subscription platform that lets you subscribe to a car of your choice at a fixed monthly subscription fee for a duration of 6, 12, or 24 months. Alternatively, if you have a car that has been idle and gathering dust, you could share it on the Zoomcar platform and save some bucks from it to offset your subscription fee. It will not only save you money but can bring down the cost significantly to make it lower than EMIs.</p>
<p>So, you now realize how you’ve subscribed to so many of these services knowingly or unknowingly. Our lives are changing as we’re moving towards subscription models to ease our lives. Paying a subscription fee to avail services &#8211; be it information, entertainment or utility has brought a great amount of convenience to people’s lives. It also gives you a chance to opt out of it when required. While you benefit from the product/ service, you can wade away the hassle of paying a hefty upfront sum to acquire an item.</p>
