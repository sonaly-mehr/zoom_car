<p>Bedroom. Kitchen. Workstation. Repeat. For the last few months, mostly everyone has been following this routine.

<p>However, to ensure safe travels, it is better to travel by a private vehicle. A road trip with your own car will allow you to make the most of the experience without any limitation.

<p>Work. Home. Sleep. Repeat. The work from home regimen in this new normal has started to take a toll on us, and we are all trying to break free from the monotony and stress of it. The most challenging aspect is that due to the monotonous routine, our productivity gets hampered as well.</p>



<p>If you feel the same pressure and are in dire need of some respite, then you need to bring a fresh change in your life. The best transition from this mundane lifestyle is planning a trip to a nearby place. Although, if you are worried about the travel arrangement, then fret not. You can explore options like <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term car subscription services</a></strong> that will enable you to travel privately.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17594" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Personal mobility is a concept that has gained importance in these unexpected times. Car rental services are the main force behind this concept. You can travel safely and ensure limited contact with people. The chances of virus transmission will significantly reduce with this one minor change.</p>



<p>Just hop in a rented car with your family and visit a nearby place to rejuvenate. We at Zoomcar offer numerous car options like SUVs, sedans, and Innovas for your comfort. Another factor adding to your convenience is the availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">monthly car-rental services</a></strong> as well as <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long- term car rental</a></strong> services.</p>



<p>Why wait when you can book any of these and explore famous places like the following:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Igatpuri:</strong> <strong>Abode For Adventure Enthusiasts</strong></li></ol>



<p>With only a distance of 130 kms from Mumbai, Igatpuri, a charming hill station, is the ideal vacation spot. Drive down the Mumbai-Agra highway and reach this destination for solace. A popular choice, especially during Mumbai monsoons, Igatpuri is home to the majestic waterfalls and tall mountains.</p>



<p>Explore the old forts and indulge in outdoor activities like rock climbing and trekking. Channel your inner artistic photographer at the Bhatsa river valley, Camel valley, and the Randha falls. Last but not least, enjoy a mesmerizing view from the top of the Trngalwadi fort.</p>



<p>If, however, after visiting this place, you want to spend some more time amidst nature, you can extend your stay easily. Work from the weekend destination with a fresh mind. Traveling back is not an issue with having a vehicle with you. Opt for the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term self-drive car rental service</a></strong> from us and extend your vacation without giving it another thought.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17595" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Kashid: Land of Sandy Beaches</strong></li></ol>



<p>Head to Kashid, a beach town, just 125 kms from Mumbai city, and explore the white sandy beaches and blue seas. Soothing and a calm place surrounded by lush green landscapes, this beach is also known for its striking mountains. With a serene environment and a shore that stretches to a vast extent, is the ideal destination for a mini-holiday.</p>



<p>The spellbound appearance with its pristine water and clean beaches makes you want to stay for a longer time. You can also explore the nearby areas like Chaul, which is a vantage point for Buddhist caves. Another place of public interest includes the Korlai fort. Experience the royal heritage in this phenomenal monument.</p>

<p>The outbreak and the subsequent spread of the novel Coronavirus have led to challenges that have never been seen before. Amidst this pandemic and the enforced lockdowns, the personal mobility of individuals has also been affected adversely.</p>



<p>Many people are not in a position to buy a car during these difficult times due to job losses and budget cuts. Moreover, people during this phase are also inclined to spend money only on essential purchases. Using public transport is also out of question due to the increased risk of virus transmission it poses. Hence, this leaves only one option for safe mobility for individuals – <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/bangalore/">long term car rentals</a></strong>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15070" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 602w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x236.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-87x67.png 87w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><figcaption>Self Drive Car Rental</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Renting cars from <strong>car rental companies</strong> during these pandemic times offer several advantages, let us take a look at them:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enables you to Follow Social Distancing Norms</strong></li></ul>



<p>It is obvious that social distancing cannot be followed properly while using public transport. Travelling in public transport without any social distancing will make you more susceptible to contracting the virus. With social distancing being considered the need of the hour, it is vital to have some means of private travelling for safe travelling. It can be done easily through <strong>monthly car rentals</strong>, that we at Zoomcar offer at affordable rates. Having a car during such tough times will allow you to maintain social distancing and travel safely.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enables you to Travel with Precautions</strong></li></ul>



<p>The <strong>best car rental services</strong> are taking the utmost precautions to provide you with safe travelling experiences. We at Zoomcar provide car pick-up and drop facilities for consumers, so that you do not have to travel to rent a car. Apart from this, we have also implemented strict hygiene and safety measures such as:</p>



<ul><li>Each part of our cars, including the seats, door and boot handles, and gears, are thoroughly sanitized before being delivered to you.</li><li>To reduce physical contact, we have leveraged best-in-class new-age technologies for implementing keyless entry (KLE) in our cars, which will allow you to lock or unlock your rented car using the Zoomcar app.</li><li>We are also conducting extensive training sessions for our employees to inform them about standard measures such as wearing face masks, washing hands for 20 seconds, and social distancing to avoid contracting the virus.</li></ul>



<p>Such hygiene and safety practices will enable you to take up an option of <strong>long-term car rental</strong> without any stress and allow you to travel with stringent precautionary measures in place.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enables you to Travel Anywhere</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>Monthly car rentals</strong> from Zoomcar come equipped with all-India permits, thus allowing you to visit travel anywhere in India with your rented car, whether it’s heading back to your home town or a simple road trip. Apart from this, we also offer 24&#215;7 roadside assistance. If you have car troubles, contact us at Zoomcar, and we will support you by taking away your car for repairs and providing you with a replacement car for that duration. To provide you with the best customer service, Zoomcar also makes use of emails, text messages, calls, and chatbots to answer your queries and doubts 24&#215;7.</p>



<p><strong>Freedom to Travel Freely with Zoomcar</strong></p>



<p>Zoomcar also offers other <strong>car rental benefits</strong> such as insurance and accident coverage and no down payment. Renting a car provides you with the benefits of owning a car, but without the financial expenses of loans, insurance premiums, registration, and taxes. It also gives you the benefit of personal mobility, allowing you to travel when and where you want without the risk of contracting the virus. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We, at Zoomcar, offer attractive and affordable <strong>long term car rental</strong> and <strong>monthly car rental</strong> packages in cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chandigarh for safe travelling. You even get to choose from car types like hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, and luxury for your rental.</p>



<p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/delhi/"><strong>Book a Zoomcar rental</strong></a> and visit your parents in your home town or go on that road trip that you have been planning for a long time!</p>

<h3>Here are some reasons why personal mobility solutions will be a life-saver for you during the pandemic</h3>



<p>No one ever anticipated that the outbreak of a pandemic would&nbsp;make our life go topsy-turvy in a way like this.&nbsp;All areas of life have been affected in one way or the other. One such aspect is travelling,&nbsp;which is now subject to the risk of transmission. Since the virus spreads through contact with infected people and objects, public transport comes across as a highly unsafe option. In such a case, personal mobility is being considered as the safest way to commute around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need of the times is to travel only when necessary. However, whenever you do need to&nbsp;move out, you must not compromise on your safety. At such times, you must look for personal mobility options to secure your family and yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some reasons why personal mobility solutions will be a life-saver for you during the pandemic:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>1. Helps You Practice Social Distancing&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most effective prevention keys&nbsp;during this pandemic is social distancing. A personal mobility option such as your car or taking a self-drive car will enable you to travel privately and safely to all the places. It will minimize transmission risk to a great extent.&nbsp;If you live in any&nbsp;big city such as Hyderabad or Bangalore and need to travel urgently with your family, choose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/Hyderabad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Innova car rental in Hyderabad</a>&nbsp;or elsewhere, instead of using public&nbsp;transport. Taking a rental car will be the best bet in case you do not have a personal vehicle. Whether you need to travel to your hometown or need to attend an important ceremony in another city, take&nbsp;Hyderabad car rental packages&nbsp;as per you needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2. Enables Easy Availability</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you have elderly parents, a sick family member or an expecting wife, you never know when you might need to visit the doctor or a hospital. At such times, having a personal mobility option such as a subscription car at your disposal will ensure that you can travel safely with your loved ones, no matter what hour of the day it is. Or, if you travel only occasionally, opt for a rental car. Some rental companies like&nbsp;Zoomcar&nbsp;offer&nbsp;hourly car rental Hyderabad&nbsp;and other city services&nbsp;to support all those who need a safe mode of travelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3. Be Sure About Sanitization&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you own a car, you must be sanitizing it well before and after every drive. Sanitization also cuts down&nbsp;the&nbsp;risk to a great extent and is a must nowadays. However, with public transport, you can never be entirely sure about this aspect, given the number of people who use it. In such a case, it would be much better to opt for a self-drive car on a monthly or yearly basis, through rental or subscription companies. Make sure to check how they sanitize their vehicles before delivering it to you. If you need to take a long-distance trip, say for an official purpose, opt for&nbsp;Innova car rental in Hyderabad&nbsp;or other cities to keep your safety in check.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4. Self-Driven Vehicle is Best&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier you may be using a cab, but now given the rapid spread of the virus, you need to keep a safe distance from every potentially infected person. Drivers of cabs also present a certain degree of risk. The best&nbsp;thing&nbsp;would be to make a shift to personal mobility where you can drive the vehicle yourself. Take&nbsp;car rentals in Hyderabad for outstation&nbsp;or inter-city use, and drive wherever and whenever you want. Even if you need to pick or drop a friend or relative, or have to get some important task done, book a&nbsp;self-drive rental&nbsp;car to commute.&nbsp;It will keep&nbsp;risk at&nbsp;bay&nbsp;during this pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Choose Personal Mobility to Stay Safe</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Since safety is a top priority right now, you need to make choices that keep you and your loved ones secure. Use only personal mobility solutions for travelling to cut down the risk of transmission. You can book self-drive cars offered by reliable companies like&nbsp;Zoomcar&nbsp;on both rental and subscription basis. They thoroughly sanitize their vehicles and deliver the same to your doorstep. You will not even need to pay any down payment when you&nbsp;take a car on subscription from them. Choosing a car on subscription from them will allow you to enjoy all the benefits of a personal vehicle, in a much more economical way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choose a means of personal mobility and secure your loved ones and yourself.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a paradigm shift in people’s priorities. From partying out on Friday nights and socializing over the weekends, most of us are prioritizing personal safety over everything else.</p>



<p>Another example of how people are focusing on safety instead of convenience in the wake of the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://udaipurkiran.com/">coronavirus pandemic</a></strong>&nbsp;is the reduced use of public transport. Many of us who do not have a personal car and had earlier been using public means of transport are now looking for solutions to travel privately. Even driver-ridden cabs are seeing a significant reduction in the passenger numbers since people are avoiding all interactions to minimize the risk of contracting the coronavirus infection.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/mumbai/"><img src="https://udaipurkiran.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ss-600x399.jpg" alt="Self Drive Car " class="wp-image-683747"/></a><figcaption>Self Drive Car Rental</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At such times, opting for&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">Zoomcar self-drive car rental</a></strong>&nbsp;service comes across as one of the best solutions to travel privately and safely. If you are wondering how Zoomcar provides you with a secure solution for travelling, then let us explain to you the same in detail below.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Offers Self-Drive Cars</strong></li></ol>



<p>When you opt for the&nbsp;<strong>Zoomcar car rental</strong>&nbsp;services, you receive a self-driven vehicle that does not need a driver. Amidst these risky times, this aspect of self-drive cars will enable you to practice social distancing without compromising on convenience and personal safety.</p>



<p>It ensures that when you and your family need to travel, there is no contact with anyone else during the trip. In a rental cab, there is the risk of the driver being a potential virus carrier, given that he may have come in contact with any other infected passengers. However, when you choose to book a self-driven rental car, the possibilities of such exposure are zero.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Provides Sanitized Vehicles</strong></li></ol>



<p>The most frightening part of Coronavirus is how easily it transmits through direct contact with an infected person or surface. When you book Zoomcar self-drive cars, the vehicle is thoroughly sanitized before it is delivered to you for use. Travelling in a self-drive rental car will allow you to travel with flair, comfort and above all, peace of mind, as the risk from coming in contact with infected surfaces or objects will be minimized or eliminated during travelling.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Delivers Quickly</strong></li></ol>



<p>In case of any emergency, you may want a safe, private vehicle urgently. For instance, if you need to take your pregnant wife to the hospital or need to visit your hometown urgently, you may not have much time in hand. At the same time, you cannot afford to compromise on safety. At such times, Zoomcar self-drive cars can be the best solution for your commuting plans.</p>



<p>Zoom car hire service provides vehicles within 30 minutes at your doorstep. You can book the rental car and travel for long and short distances just whenever you want. In these uncertain times, if you do not have a personal vehicle, then taking a rental car would be a better option than hailing a taxi or cab or using public means of transport, for ensuring safety.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Offers for Varied Durations</strong></li></ol>



<p>Depending on your travel requirements, you may need a private vehicle for varied durations. Zoomcar self-drive car rental service provides you vehicles for a one-side journey, two-way trip or on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis. They offer both rental and subscription option while enabling you to make bookings for any travel plans – whether intercity or interstate.</p>



<p>Whether you need a means of personal mobility for commuting to your office, finishing pending household tasks, or picking and dropping a family member, using a self-drive will allow you to travel while keeping the risk at bay.</p>



<p><strong>Secure all Your Travel Plans with Zoomcar</strong></p>



<p>If you do not own a car and are not even willing to invest in one right now, then a rental car will be the best solution for personal mobility.

<p>Planning and preparation play a vital role in the success of any endeavour, be it an event or a trip. When it comes to making a trip, especially a long-distance one, you need to consider several things before getting started. Primarily, these days, when travelling just like other aspects of life has become subjected to the risk of virus transmission, you need to take every necessary step there is to secure your trip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of taking a trip, the first thing you should figure out is a safe means of mobility and then move to pack all necessary items. Amidst the critical situations of the pandemic, the safest commuting option right now is to <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/mumbai/"><strong>choose an option of personal mobility.</strong></a> If you do not own a vehicle, then you can opt for either a self-drive rental or subscription car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img width="602" height="401" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4aw1J2LotArtHJ23Z1VpeTXV3kMhR1iui02-o_qqt1cx8ozFsksa8jLE4eWbVN_F13nFgEC53V175EPQ4Cy8ORAc3ASAWtmrrZEF7zxmnrZiT_GppsP85_GQuV7GGt_4H8rEP3FEX1ixTdw_HA"></p>



<p>Apart from choosing the right means of commutation, here is a list of things you must carry along to ensure a safe trip. Read below to find out:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Mask</strong></li></ol>



<p>Consider carrying a mask<strong> </strong>with you at all times as the new normal. Even if you are traveling through a means of personal mobility, it is still advisable that you carry a few masks with you. Wearing masks ensure that you remain protected even when you need to get down on the way or meet someone at the destination. Keep the extra masks in a proper box or bag, so that they remain free from pathogens, dust, and pollutants too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Sanitizers&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>Gone are the days when only the hygiene-conscious people carried sanitizers with them. Now, with the prevailing risk, sanitizers have become an essential thing to carry along every time you venture out. Although commuting through your vehicle or self-drive rental car ensures that there is minimum risk of coming in contact with virus-ridden objects, using the sanitizer frequently will further kill the virus, if it gets to you through the hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>First-Aid Kit&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>God forbid, if your vehicle meets with any small collision or accident and someone gets injured, a first-aid kit will come in handy to provide medical support instantly. So, prepare a small medical kit comprising of a disinfectant, band-aids, gauze pads and dressings, antiseptic wipes, and other related things and keep it in your car.&nbsp; Also, it would be best if you can keep a small emergency blanket as well as contact details of medical facilities along your route. Better stay safe than sorry.</p>



<p>In case you take a <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/bangalore/"><strong>self-drive Zoomcar</strong></a> from us and face a breakdown, then you may not worry about roadside assistance. We, at Zoomcar, offer roadside assistance to all our renters and subscribers.&nbsp; However, you must take all steps to ensure personal safety.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Basic Food and Drinks&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>While stopping at a roadside Dhaba may seem to be an exciting idea, but not when it puts your safety at stake. Notably, during current times, when there is so much risk of virus transmission, it is best to carry basic food and drinks with you in your car. It will ensure that you do not need to stopover at places to satisfy your hunger pangs. Also, keeping food is a must if you have small kids or patients who may need to be fed from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Basic medicines</strong></li></ol>



<p>There are chances that you or any of your loved ones may feel sick while on a trip. Especially when it is a long-distance journey, and the roads are uphill and meandering, many people feel nausea, vertigo, or headaches. Precisely during these times, to ensure that you don’t have to frantically search for a medical shop, you must carry a few essential, over-the-counter medicines with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Plan a Safe and Secure Trip</strong></p>



<p>It would help if you first chose a safe commuting option like that in itself will offer you a great deal of security during these unsafe times. In the absence of a personal vehicle, you may choose to opt for a rental or <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe"><strong>subscription car</strong></a> as offered by us at Zoomcar. We sanitize our cars thoroughly and deliver the same in the shortest time possible. Using a personal mobility option, whether your own or rental car will allow you to practice social distancing norms in the best way possible. Apart from this, carry all essential things as mentioned above and any other thing that you can think of to ensure that you and your loved ones can travel safely without getting exposed to any preventable risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
