<p>Bedroom. Kitchen. Workstation. Repeat. For the last few months, mostly everyone has been following this routine.

<p>Come to think of it, while adjusting to the new normal, don’t you think trips with your friends have become a thing of the past? When did you go on a trip or a vacation recently?</p>



<p>All our travel plans had to be canceled or brought to a halt due to the risk of virus contraction during the pandemic. Now, a trip to the grocery store feels like a short trip away from home. However, even for a quick visit outside your home, it is essential to keep in mind the safety measures. The risks and the insecurity of virus contraction still lingers. Thus, you can opt for another alternative like car rental services for your daily travels instead of public transport. Similarly, you could hire car rental services for a short trip somewhere around the city.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17614" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A significant <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">benefit of car rental</a></strong> services is that it enables you to travel securely. Instead of traveling in crowded places where the chances of contracting the disease are higher, travel privately.</p>



<p>Apart from securing your daily commute, you may even plan for a short trip with your friends. While international trips are out of the question right now, how about a small weekend getaway to power upon inspiration. With our services, you can benefit from<strong> <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">self-drive cars</a></strong> and avail of a <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">car rental for a short trip</a></strong>. Clear your mind off the stress from work from home routine and the pressure of lockdown. Especially if you love to travel, explore the following options of places to make your next visit:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Nandi Hills: Abode of Tranquillity</strong></li></ul>



<p>Do you want to plan a one-day trip? If yes, then visit Nandi hills, just sixty km away from Bangalore city. This recently discovered tourist spot has also become a well-known getaway. Plus, this is the ideal time to visit Nandi hills and experience pleasant weather with a panoramic view.</p>



<p>Get mesmerized by the majestic pillars of its monuments and shrines. Wake up early and cycle on the roads of Nandi hills amidst the splendid greenery. Visit Tipu’s drop for a breathtaking view or enjoy paragliding in this scenic hill station.</p>



<p>Take a <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe">car subscription for a short trip from Bangalore</a></strong> from us and ensure your safety.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 brought along with it a tough challenge for the world. Especially the past few months spent under lockdown have been tiring mentally. We all can agree to this!</p>



<p>However, these last few months have taught one thing – Better Be Safe Than Sorry! After the lockdown-unlock, public transport has started to run; schools are opening up, and so are offices. Thus, it would help if you viewed everything, especially your commutation options, from a safety aspect. Re-starting public transportation services might be a practical decision to ensure a normality step, but it does not guarantee safety. On the other hand, personal mobility enables security and safety while traveling.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17273" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With personal mobility, you can upkeep the norm of social distancing and travel without worrying. The availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> will enable you to travel privately if you do not own a car. If you are hesitant about these services, you can <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">subscribe a car</a></strong> for a day and see for yourself. Our services, at Zoomcar, offer vehicles for varying durations- daily, monthly, weekly, and annual.</p>



<p>The best aspect is that subscribing to a car will have similar advantages to having a personal vehicle. It enables you to travel in all kinds of situations, such as:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Day-to-Day Travel</strong></li></ol>



<p>With resuming offices, you might have to start traveling daily. If you availed the public transport services like buses and metros for commutation before the coronavirus outbreak, it would not be wise to do so now. Cases are still on the rise every day, so it is important that you carefully consider daily commutation options. As an easy alternative, you opt for <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> and travel securely instead.</p>



<p>Even if you have to visit the grocery store, you should avoid crowded places. Such places have more exposure to the virus. &nbsp;Avoid hiring or sharing cabs, so limit contact with people. This way, you will be able to restrict the transmission of the virus and be safe at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Emergency Hospital Visit</strong></li></ul>



<p>The need to visit the hospital can arise at any point in time. Especially if you have elderly parents or an expecting wife, you may unexpectedly require visiting the hospital.</p>



<p>If you <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">subscribe a car</a>, </strong>you will not have to look for safer transport options in critical times. Nor will you require wasting time waiting for a friend to bring a car. Instead, similar to a privately owned vehicle, the subscribed car will be at your doorstep for use until the subscription duration. So, why wait for a challenging situation to give you a push. Avail <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> from us to handle all emergencies without difficulty.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17274" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Visiting Hometown</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you could not go back to your hometown due to the lockdown, you can now travel safely. As it has been a rough couple of months, you might want to visit your parents to spend some quality time with them.</p>



<p>After visiting, if you feel like extending your trip, you will not worry about traveling back. Just avail the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">self-drive car-subscription</a></strong> option and travel around as and when you feel like.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inter-city Business Travels</strong></li></ul>



<p>Getting back on your feet at your work can be a challenging task in such a situation. You might have to travel to a different city to meet your investors or to fulfill precarious business commitments. Do not let the non-availability of a safe mode of transport compromise your work.</p>



<p>Avail our<a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/"> <strong>self-drive car-subscription </strong></a>option and travel securely. You can conduct these meetings in the car itself. This safe space will help you keep your business running and get back on track.</p>



<p>These few situations are examples of how <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> will help, even in the long run. With no vaccine in sight, who knows for how long this situation is going to continue. Hence, you must prepare for the time ahead and secure all your travel plans with long-term <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong>. The most significant advantage it that it is essential mobility support while it will help keep the risk at bay.</p>



<p><strong>Secure Your Traveling with Subscription Cars</strong></p>



<p>Additionally, long-term <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> are also beneficial if you plan a short trip with your family or your loved ones. With our services at Zoomcar, we understand your requirement and bring the most suitable solutions in front of you. We provide an all-India permit for all our vehicles so that you can travel everywhere easily. Besides, we also offer 24x 7 roadside assistance so that if your car breaks down anywhere, you get help quickly.  </p>

<p>Traveling influences the lives of most individuals in positive ways. Whether it’s an ‘around-the-world’ adventure or a quick weekend getaway, travel is essential for peace of mind. However, this year, many travel plans had to be put on hold due to the pandemic. Moreover, due to the hectic work-from-home lifestyle and lockdown, life has become a bit dull and drab for everyone. Making everyone long for some fresh air, away from home, and having fun experiences.<br><br>However, now that things have started to get a bit normalized, traveling has been resumed. Although, it is imperative to remember that risks and insecurities of virus transmission still lingers. There is a simple solution to counter this problem, especially for those who love to travel – the option of choosing a secure and safe mode of traveling with personal mobility options. Getting a <strong>self-drive car subscription</strong> enables you to travel within and outside the city as per your comfort, while ensuring that you stay safe and secure!<br><br></p>
