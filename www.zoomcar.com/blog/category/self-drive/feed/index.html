<p>Bedroom. Kitchen. Workstation. Repeat. For the last few months, mostly everyone has been following this routine.

The need to take a break, and finding a getaway has never been as essential as it has become now. Hence, the best way to infuse some excitement into your life is to plan a road trip to a nearby place.</p>

<p>However, to ensure safe travels, it is better to travel by a private vehicle. A road trip with your own car will allow you to make the most of the experience without any limitation. If, however, you do not have a vehicle, you can opt for <a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">car rental services</a>. We at Zoomcar provide cars for diverse durations.

<p>Especially if you live in Pune, there are great places to visit nearby for the weekend. Escape to any of the following destinations and take a break in the new normal:</p>

<p>Work. Home. Sleep. Repeat. The work from home regimen in this new normal has started to take a toll on us, and we are all trying to break free from the monotony and stress of it. The most challenging aspect is that due to the monotonous routine, our productivity gets hampered as well.</p>



<p>If you feel the same pressure and are in dire need of some respite, then you need to bring a fresh change in your life. The best transition from this mundane lifestyle is planning a trip to a nearby place. Although, if you are worried about the travel arrangement, then fret not. You can explore options like <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term car subscription services</a></strong> that will enable you to travel privately.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17594" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Personal mobility is a concept that has gained importance in these unexpected times. Car rental services are the main force behind this concept. You can travel safely and ensure limited contact with people. The chances of virus transmission will significantly reduce with this one minor change.</p>



<p>Just hop in a rented car with your family and visit a nearby place to rejuvenate. We at Zoomcar offer numerous car options like SUVs, sedans, and Innovas for your comfort. Another factor adding to your convenience is the availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">monthly car-rental services</a></strong> as well as <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long- term car rental</a></strong> services.</p>



<p>Why wait when you can book any of these and explore famous places like the following:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Igatpuri:</strong> <strong>Abode For Adventure Enthusiasts</strong></li></ol>



<p>With only a distance of 130 kms from Mumbai, Igatpuri, a charming hill station, is the ideal vacation spot. Drive down the Mumbai-Agra highway and reach this destination for solace. A popular choice, especially during Mumbai monsoons, Igatpuri is home to the majestic waterfalls and tall mountains.</p>



<p>Explore the old forts and indulge in outdoor activities like rock climbing and trekking. Channel your inner artistic photographer at the Bhatsa river valley, Camel valley, and the Randha falls. Last but not least, enjoy a mesmerizing view from the top of the Trngalwadi fort.</p>



<p>If, however, after visiting this place, you want to spend some more time amidst nature, you can extend your stay easily. Work from the weekend destination with a fresh mind. Traveling back is not an issue with having a vehicle with you. Opt for the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">long-term self-drive car rental service</a></strong> from us and extend your vacation without giving it another thought.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17595" width="600" height="400"/><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Kashid: Land of Sandy Beaches</strong></li></ol>



<p>Head to Kashid, a beach town, just 125 kms from Mumbai city, and explore the white sandy beaches and blue seas. Soothing and a calm place surrounded by lush green landscapes, this beach is also known for its striking mountains. With a serene environment and a shore that stretches to a vast extent, is the ideal destination for a mini-holiday.</p>



<p>The spellbound appearance with its pristine water and clean beaches makes you want to stay for a longer time. You can also explore the nearby areas like Chaul, which is a vantage point for Buddhist caves. Another place of public interest includes the Korlai fort. Experience the royal heritage in this phenomenal monument.</p>



<p>If you need to use the local transport in these vacation spots, you can avoid that with a car by your side. Even when you are eating out, ensure that you pick up food from the eateries following the social distancing norms instead of dining in. Especially when you are traveling, it will be wise to carry some snacks and beverages for the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 brought along with it a tough challenge for the world. Especially the past few months spent under lockdown have been tiring mentally. We all can agree to this!</p>



<p>However, these last few months have taught one thing – Better Be Safe Than Sorry! After the lockdown-unlock, public transport has started to run; schools are opening up, and so are offices. Thus, it would help if you viewed everything, especially your commutation options, from a safety aspect. Re-starting public transportation services might be a practical decision to ensure a normality step, but it does not guarantee safety. On the other hand, personal mobility enables security and safety while traveling.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17273" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With personal mobility, you can upkeep the norm of social distancing and travel without worrying. The availability of <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> will enable you to travel privately if you do not own a car. If you are hesitant about these services, you can <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">subscribe a car</a></strong> for a day and see for yourself. Our services, at Zoomcar, offer vehicles for varying durations- daily, monthly, weekly, and annual.</p>



<p>The best aspect is that subscribing to a car will have similar advantages to having a personal vehicle. It enables you to travel in all kinds of situations, such as:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Day-to-Day Travel</strong></li></ol>



<p>With resuming offices, you might have to start traveling daily. If you availed the public transport services like buses and metros for commutation before the coronavirus outbreak, it would not be wise to do so now. Cases are still on the rise every day, so it is important that you carefully consider daily commutation options. As an easy alternative, you opt for <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> and travel securely instead.</p>



<p>Even if you have to visit the grocery store, you should avoid crowded places. Such places have more exposure to the virus. &nbsp;Avoid hiring or sharing cabs, so limit contact with people. This way, you will be able to restrict the transmission of the virus and be safe at all times.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Emergency Hospital Visit</strong></li></ul>



<p>The need to visit the hospital can arise at any point in time. Especially if you have elderly parents or an expecting wife, you may unexpectedly require visiting the hospital.</p>



<p>If you <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">subscribe a car</a>, </strong>you will not have to look for safer transport options in critical times. Nor will you require wasting time waiting for a friend to bring a car. Instead, similar to a privately owned vehicle, the subscribed car will be at your doorstep for use until the subscription duration. So, why wait for a challenging situation to give you a push. Avail <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> from us to handle all emergencies without difficulty.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17274" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Visiting Hometown</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you could not go back to your hometown due to the lockdown, you can now travel safely. As it has been a rough couple of months, you might want to visit your parents to spend some quality time with them.</p>



<p>After visiting, if you feel like extending your trip, you will not worry about traveling back. Just avail the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">self-drive car-subscription</a></strong> option and travel around as and when you feel like.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inter-city Business Travels</strong></li></ul>



<p>Getting back on your feet at your work can be a challenging task in such a situation. You might have to travel to a different city to meet your investors or to fulfill precarious business commitments. Do not let the non-availability of a safe mode of transport compromise your work.</p>



<p>Avail our<a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/"> <strong>self-drive car-subscription </strong></a>option and travel securely. You can conduct these meetings in the car itself. This safe space will help you keep your business running and get back on track.</p>



<p>These few situations are examples of how <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> will help, even in the long run. With no vaccine in sight, who knows for how long this situation is going to continue. Hence, you must prepare for the time ahead and secure all your travel plans with long-term <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong>. The most significant advantage it that it is essential mobility support while it will help keep the risk at bay.</p>



<p><strong>Secure Your Traveling with Subscription Cars</strong></p>



<p>Additionally, long-term <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/zap/subscribe/">car-subscription services</a></strong> are also beneficial if you plan a short trip with your family or your loved ones. With our services at Zoomcar, we understand your requirement and bring the most suitable solutions in front of you. We provide an all-India permit for all our vehicles so that you can travel everywhere easily. Besides, we also offer 24x 7 roadside assistance so that if your car breaks down anywhere, you get help quickly.  </p>

Visiting a nearby place around your location offers you the much-needed respite, and it goes easy on your pockets. If you live in or around Mumbai and need a stress-buster, you can explore these destinations and plan a mini-vacation.</p>

Ensure that you do not dine in to avoid any chances of contamination or transmission as safety measures.</p>



<p>You can spend your time in outdoor activities like jet-ski, kayaking, and pedal boating. Visit the Tikona fort and the Devkund waterfall for a refreshing experience and panoramic views.</p>



<p>Have a fun-filled weekend trip but make sure that all preventive measures are followed. Opt for <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">car-rental service</a></strong> to enjoy your trip in a seamless manner, while also making sure you and your loved ones stay safe. Renting a car enables you to maintain social distance, which is impossible if you use public transport.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Lonavala: Alluring Hill Station</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you are eyeing an escape from the Mumbai heat, Lonavala is the place to visit. With just one and a half hours away from Mumbai city, this misty weekend getaway is perfect for a one-day trip as well. Opt for the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">one-day car-rental service</a></strong> to ensure a safe journey, whether you have planned a solo trip or a trip with your loved ones. In case you want to prolong your trip, you can visit Khandala, another hill station nearby. If you plan to add extra days to your trip, you can simply extend the <strong><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">car-rental for a week</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Lonavala is a captivatingly scenic region, and the best time to visit is during the monsoon season. However, the ghats’ beauty, the lush greens around surely will leave you mesmerized any time of the year. &nbsp;Get an immersive experience trekking, camping, and indulging in other water sports amidst the waterfalls and dense forests. Apart from this, you can visit the Rajmachi fort, Ryewood lake, and other places.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day to day life is made easier with having a personal vehicle. Don’t you agree?</span></strong></p>



<p>Instead of the hassles of using public transport, you can commute independently and freely whenever you want. The need for personal mobility has increased from a safety aspect due to the coronavirus outbreak. Personal mobility ensures that you are able to limit interaction with people, allowing you to follow the protocols of social distancing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16977" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If, however, you do not own a vehicle, you can always opt for car rental services. A significant advantage is that we, at Zoomcar, offer <strong>short term car rental</strong> services as well as long-term rental cars in Pune.</p>



<p>Having a <strong>short term car rental</strong> service is the best solution to enjoy the same benefits that come with a personal car, such as the following:</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Safety</strong></li></ol>



<p>It has already been established that the coronavirus has a high tendency to spread faster in crowded places, so it will be wise to avoid such areas. Today, with the slow and steady unlocking of the country, offices have started to resume work, schools have started with their session, and travelers are out to travel again.</p>



<p>Considering that we don’t have a vaccine for the virus yet, car rental services are a blessing for those who need or want to travel safely and securely. Suppose you are unsure about opting for long-term car rental. In that case, you can enjoy our <strong>short term car subscription services</strong> like the <strong>daily car rental service</strong> or the <strong>weekly car rental service</strong>. This way, you can easily determine if a long-term car subscription is the right choice for you. Another safety aspect that a <strong>daily car rental service</strong> provides is that it offers protection against the possibility of virus transmission. Like, if you hail a cab, you will be in contact with the cab driver due to currency exchange, and you will be breathing the same air as them. To avoid such a situation, you should opt for personal mobility and <strong>rent a car for a short term. </strong>You will be driving the vehicle yourself and thus eliminating the risk of coming in contact with strangers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16978" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png 468w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.zoomcar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-270x180.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Self-Reliance</strong></li></ol>



<p>The best aspect of having a vehicle at all times is that you will not have to rely on anyone else. Suppose you have old grandparents or an expecting wife, and an emergency arises. In that case, you won’t have to wait for your friends or relatives. Commuting via public transport is out of the question in such critical times; it will be best to have a car at your doorstep.</p>



<p>With <strong>short term car rental</strong> services, you can assure yourself with safety as well as convenience, and if you are comfortable with the service, you can extend it. At Zoomcar, we offer car rentals on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis for you to select from.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Affordable Travelling</strong></li></ul>



<p>Buying a vehicle at this juncture should be avoided. If you had to dip in your savings due to the pandemic, it might turn out to be a considerable investment. Therefore, the ideal option is to avail of a <strong>short term car rental</strong> service, the next best alternative. While providing all the facilities that a personal vehicle offers, it is an inexpensive solution to your travel worries.</p>



<p>If you are bored working from home and feel as if life has become dull, you can plan a short weekend getaway. As already mentioned above, the country is moving towards a completed unlock. Hence, the weekend resorts and tourists place are open for visiting. Having a rented vehicle will save the transportation costs of reaching the destination and also secure your trip. If you become satisfied with the <strong>short term rental </strong>service, you can avail of our long-term car subscription and plan such getaways from time to time.</p>



<p><strong>Travel Safe And Happy</strong></p>



<p>We at Zoomcar provide many other benefits, including the ones mentioned above. These include cars with damage insurance and an-all India permit. Now, plan your short trips without any worry. In a situation where the car breaks down in the middle of the road, we ensure that help reaches you with our 24x 7 roadside assistance benefit. We also make certain that all our cars are thoroughly sanitized after every use. Additionally, we make sure that the vehicle is dropped off at your doorstep within thirty minutes of subscribing for your convenience. &nbsp;We prioritize your well-being and ensure that you can travel everywhere with the utmost security. Of all the things to be concerned about in this crisis, traveling should not be one!</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in a global pandemic is certainly unfortunate. While everyone is advised to observe proper precautions, stay indoors, observe social distancing, and maintain proper personal hygiene, Zoomcar has been coming up with provisions to better take care of their customers. In times of lockdown, mobility is certainly challenged. However, through its fleet of over 10,000 cars, <strong>Zoomcar is ensuring that mobility-as-a-service is available for anyone who needs it.</strong> Furthermore, as India’s largest and fastest-growing self-drive service provider, Zoomcar is also gearing up to ensure the optimum safety of customers after the lockdown is lifted.</p>



<h3>Access to clean and sanitized cars</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.zoomcar.com/">Car rentals</a> carry a lesser risk of infections than other modes of public transportation. Furthermore, Zoomcar is ensuring that patrons of the brand remain safeguarded from the risks. To that measure, the team is inspecting each car. At a time of inspection, every Zoomcar is completely sanitized and cleaned with tissues, including the keys, steering wheel, gears, front and back door handles, and pocket door hand rest.</p>



<h3>Keyless entry to Zoomcar</h3>



<p>Zoomcar has adopted cutting-edge technologies such as IoT to ensure seamless access to cars without the use of keys. Users opting for Zoomcar can unlock it using the app to find sanitized and clean keys placed within. This further reduces the risks of spreading the virus.</p>



<h3>Training the employees</h3>



<p>On-ground employees are essential for the operations of Zoomcar. However, in these times of crisis, Zoomcar has been quick to train the staff in maintaining personal hygiene, the sole chief weapon in the fight against the Corona-storm. The company has conducted extensive sessions with the employees and fleet operators on standard recommendations for preventing the infection; this includes properly washing hands with soap for 20 seconds before and after inspecting the vehicle or a pickup or drop, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illnesses such as coughing and sneezing, etc.</p>



<h3>Offering shared yet personal mobility solutions</h3>



<p>In the times of a pandemic, users are expected to be cautious and avoid public transportation. However, not everyone has the wherewithal to own a car. To that measure, Zoomcar is helping customers with completely personal albeit shared mobility solutions through car subscriptions. Now at nominal prices, users can simply subscribe to a car for a duration varying from 3 months to a year or more. Zoomcar further expects a significant increase in long-duration bookings for intra city use cases. The company plans to introduce better pricing for its cars and ensure accessibility to its mobility-as-a-service offering for the masses.</p>
