<p>Road trips are the perfect stressbusters and taking a self-drive car of your choice gives you the opportunity to enjoy the drive with your family and friends. Make pitstops (read chai breaks) and drive at your convenience and leisure. You could opt for a hatchback or an SUV for this drive.</p>
<p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> December to February or July to August</p>
<p>It is said that to travel is to live. So, don’t wait up! Pack your bags, and head to this lovely town! Book your Zoomcar below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come winter, it is time to pack up the woollen clothes and head to the hills for some rest and relaxation. If you seek the allure of a destination that is truly off the beaten track, head to Bhubaneshwar and take the long drive to a gem that has been hidden in plain sight; the hill station of Daringbadi. Having dense woods, coffee plantations and waterfalls, the picturesque Daringbadi is a quiet place to sneak away to for a long weekend.</p>
<p><strong>A Hill Station Like No Other</strong></p>
<p>While Odisha is renowned for it’s famous temples and national parks, nestled in the Kandhamal district of Odisha, this charming hill station located at an altitude of 915 km has been shielded from aggressive tourism. Hence there are very few places to stay here such as Deers Eco Home and Hotel Utopia. Like most hill stations, Daringbadi holds wondrous sights for travellers in the winter months between November and January when it experiences snowfall. Buses and cabs ply between Daringbadi and Behrampur which is the closest railway station about 125 km away. The drive from Bhubaneshwar to Daringbadi of roughly 250 km is one that will gift you with many spectacular views to be cherished for a lifetime. Take the NH16 and NH157 route passing through the towns of Asika and Surada to reach this choice destination which has picture perfect sunsets.</p>

<p>You can see the dense woods of pine trees or the mist hanging over the valley here, and the verdant hills of Daringbadi can be viewed from the Hill View Point. Other scenic spots to be added to your itinerary would be the coffee and pepper plantations and Lover’s Point. The Rushikulya river which has been a vital place of interest to observe the Olive Ridley turtles, also originates in this hill station. Be it the falls, the Doluri river, the various picnic spots where one can still experience quiet and solitude, Daringbadi is a gift to all the travellers yearning for a place that has not been overpopulated by tourism. Tip: Do stock up on essentials while heading here and expect patchy mobile network in this area.</p>

<p>A prominent waterfall of Orissa, the Putudi falls are located near Phulbani which is a two hour drive from Daringbadi. The wild tropical forests of Belaghar which also houses a wildlife sanctuary is located around 100 km from Daringbadi. Here you will get to see virgin lands populated by fauna such as wild elephants and deer. You can venture into the internationally declared eco-village of the Dongia tribe in Belaghar.</p>
<p>When you walk through the valleys of Daringbadi, you will be taken aback at how much of this place (like many of the spots in Kandhamal) remain unexplored and make discoveries of quiet water bodies and picnic spots that are not frequented by many people. If you do drive down to visit Daringbadi, Phulbani and Belaghar, you could also visit Mandasaru which is an hour’s drive away and observe the birds, waterfalls and green forests, visible from the watchtower here. Kandhamal has many destinations that are closely spaced and boast of rich flora and fauna. A nature lover’s paradise, drive down to Daringbadi to experience the vivid beauty of Odisha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, you’ve had at least one nightmare where your motorcycle gets stolen. The closest encounter I’ve had was when my neighbour got his CBR stolen, while mine was parked less than 10 meters (30 feet) away. MFW I heard what happened the next morning:</p>
<p>The same evening I came back home at around 12am, and sat next to my motorcycle until it was daytime. I was that worked up.<br />
Anywho, I spent the next few days researching security measures, and common practices of thieves. I’m sharing the results with you in hopes of saving a few wheels out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this point in my life I didn’t have a garage, so I had to park in front of my building</p></blockquote>
<h3>1. Say NO to gated-parking garages in apartment complexes.</h3>
<p>That’s the first place where thieves go “shopping”. This is especially relevant in the US. The following high-risk places are:</p>
<ul>
<li>apartment complex parking spots</li>
<li>parking garages</li>
<li>detached garages at apartment complexes</li>
<li>College “bike parking”</li>
<li>Shopping mall parking spots</li>
</ul>
<p>So where do I park? If you absolutely cannot park inside the house/garage, rent a self-storage unit near your home. Make sure you invest in heavy duty locks — normal garage doors are easy to break into, as easy as stealing door codes are.</p>
<p>If you live in the US, parking at home/home garage has additional benefits: in addition to theft, you can be charged with breaking and entering. The charges get worse if the residents are at home, even worse if a child is present in the home, and worst if any of the tools they carry can be classified as weapons. TLDR, park in your garage and make some babies. If none are an option, see #7.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_58" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-003.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58"><img class="size-bd-large wp-image-58" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-003-850x491.jpg" alt="an hero" width="1280" height="785" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-58" class="wp-caption-text">Sen. Bernie Sanders revealed a secret Wednesday night.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>2. NEVER leave your spare keys or documents in the trunk.</h3>
<p>This one should be no-brainer, but you’d be surprised at how many people do this out of convenience.</p>
<h3>3. Be wary of second-hand dealers and bike-mover companies.</h3>
<p>When getting a bike from a second hand dealer, try to leave as little information as possible — no address, full name etc. More than often they are involved in the game. Same goes for motorcycle movers. Try to arrange your own transport whenever you can.</p>
<h3>4. Is your bike a high-risk target?</h3>
<p>If you own any of the following, brace yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Sport</li>
<li>Harley</li>
<li>0–3 year old model</li>
</ul>
<p>These are highest on the “shopping list” for thieves. Anything that is 7+ years old is unlikely to get stolen. Still, that doesn’t mean you can leave it unchained in the street, got it?</p>
<h3>5. If someone already tried stealing your bike and failed, they WILL be back for it.</h3>
<p>Get that bike someplace safe. NOW.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_61" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-101.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-61"><img class="size-medium wp-image-61" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-101.jpg" alt="an hero" width="200" height="300" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61" class="wp-caption-text">an hero</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>6. If you just got a replacement for your stolen bike, they WILL be back for it.</h3>
<p>While you are reaping that sweet sweet karma from your insurance, and enjoying your new pair of wheels, they are already putting you on the “to-do” list. See #5 for instructions.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-102.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-39"><img class="size-medium wp-image-39" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-102.jpg" alt="an hero" width="200" height="300" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39" class="wp-caption-text">an hero</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>7. There is no single-best security solution.</h3>
<p>You first need to understand how the minds of thieves work. They will be looking for the fastest/most quiet way of stealing that bike. Therefore, a combination of security systems that look tedious to break will be the best solution. What does this mean? A best solutions is having ALL 3 of the following:</p>
<h4>1) A disk lock on the REAR wheel</h4>
<p>Do not buy anything that costs under $90–100. I’m serious. Best bet options would be something like this XENA Disk Lock or ABUS Disk Lock, both equipped with alarms. Cutting these locks will most probably not be an option, while removing a rear wheel is a lot harder/longer than the front one.</p>
<h4>2) A chain lock going trough HARD PARTS of the bike</h4>
<p>ex. frame, braced swingarm etc. If this is not an option, opt for sliding it through the rear wheel and placing the disk lock on the front one. Just make sure that you don’t chain it to a picket fence.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> try to have the chain as high as possible. When the chain is not near or touching the ground it’s a LOT harder to cut.</p>
<p>Same as the disk lock, don’t buy anything below $100. Some safe options are this KRYPTONITE Chain, this ABUS Chain or anything in the same category. Every thief has a pair of nice bolt-cutters that can cut trough any cheap chain. High-end chains will take a LOT more time to cut, as well as make a lot of noise. Time and noise are the thief’s worst enemy.</p>
<h4>3) Lock the damn steering</h4>
<p>Yes, I know some are very easy to break, but add it to the two above, and it’s just another item on the “time schedule”.</p>
<h4>Note 1</h4>
<p>In case you have LoJack or anything similar installed, make sure you keep the wiring and boxes out of the obvious places. They will definitely be looking for any non-OEM wires/hardware under the seat and tank. LoJack stickers are even worse; only maybe when you don’t actually have a gps unit, in which case — good job making them look. If you want to go really crazy, make/buy something like this and stick it in the headlights or something.</p>
<h4>Note 2</h4>
<p>In case you cover your bike with a tarp, get another cheaper lock with an alarm and use that to tie up the tarp around the bike. That’s an additional hassle for thieves; it makes noise, and they have no idea what’s waiting for them underneath in terms of security.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_50" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-007.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50"><img class="size-full wp-image-50" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zoom-blog-image/2016/04/woo-logo-007.jpg" alt="an hero" width="1280" height="785" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-50" class="wp-caption-text">Photos by North Vietnamese photographers show the war like it&#8217;s never been seen.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>8. Chain bikes one to another when travelling.</h3>
<p>This one should be a no-brainer as well.</p>
<h3>9. How to spot a “scout”?</h3>
<p>Your bike will be scouted numerous time, and you better be sure that by now the thieves know your daily routine.</p>
<p>A common occurrence would be a person walking with a dog or a kid. What they are doing is checking for any devices that have alarms. If someone spots them while scouting, they can say the dog or kid tipped the alarm off.</p>
<h3>10. So how is it done?</h3>
<p>The average time thieves would spend on stealing a bike is 30 sec. The most they would dare spend is a couple of minutes. This is where the 3 points from #7 come to play — time.</p>
<p>The order of events being carried out during a job are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ignition is set up to be ready for start</li>
<li>Safety equipment removed (disk lock, chain)</li>
<li>Steering lock is snapped</li>
<li>Ignition is plugged, bike is started</li>
<li>The bike is taken out of sight and checked for GPS devices</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, the bike might be left someplace else in the neighbourhood; covered and locked up. In case your bike goes missing, make sure you scout the area for any covered bikes.</p>
<h3>Final Note</h3>
<p>A lot of this info came from posts and comments on /r/motorcycles, so I want to pay my respects where they are due.</p>
